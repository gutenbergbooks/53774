<h2 title=""><i>The Mercer Boys in the Ghost Patrol</i></h2>
<p class="center">BY CAPWELL WYCKOFF</p>
<p>The summer camp of Woodcrest Military Institute was
always an exciting event to the Mercer boys and Terry
Mackson. But when the cadets camped near Rustling
Ridge, the boys ran into a series of startling occurrences:
a horse stampede, a mysterious fire, the disappearance of
a little girl, and most frightening of all, the Ghost of
Rustling Ridge, who seemed determined to drive the
cadets away.</p>
<p>Don and Jim, along with Terry, were appointed to the
camp&rsquo;s Ghost Patrol, and how they solved the mystery
of the ghost makes one of the most exciting adventures
in the Mercer Boys Series.</p>

<p>A number of young men in the gray uniforms
which formed the ordinary dress of the cadets at
Woodcrest Military Institute stood around the
counter in the school supply room. It was early
in July and the summer encampment was at hand.
It was the custom at Woodcrest for the third and
second classmen to go to summer camp, while the
younger classmen and the seniors went home for
their vacation. The score or more of young soldiers
who were in the supply room this July afternoon
were busy getting their camping uniforms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>During the school year the neat, distinguished
gray uniforms were worn, but on the encampment
the more serviceable campaign uniforms, patterned
after those worn by the United States Army,
were required.</p>
<p>A tall, red-headed cadet, with twinkling eyes
and a humorous expression perpetually on his
good-natured, freckled face, was at the moment
the next one to be waited on. He gave the sizes of
his garments and then grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is convenient, I&rsquo;d like a uniform in a shade
to match my hair!&rdquo; he requested. This grin was
answered by half a dozen others, for Terry Mackson
was a great favorite with his classmates in the
new second class, into which he and his pals, the
Mercer boys, had just graduated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have nothing as red as all that,&rdquo; the cadet
clerk grinned in return. &ldquo;Would something in
deep orange do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly it would, if you are careful to get
something that won&rsquo;t conflict with my beauty!&rdquo;
returned the cadet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t a thing in stock that would conflict
with or detract from your beauty,&rdquo; said the clerk,
gravely. &ldquo;These uniforms are ugly in the extreme,
and I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t find them a drawback in
the least, Mr. Mackson!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well spoken, my lad!&rdquo; approved Terry. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
have the plainest uniform you have. Natural
beauty ennobles whatever enshrines it, so bring
out whatever you have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why bother with a uniform at all?&rdquo; laughed
the cadet clerk. &ldquo;The colonel and the rest of us
will be so busy admiring your looks that we won&rsquo;t
notice anything else!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a general laugh at this, as Dick
Rowen, the cadet in charge of the commissary department,
stepped to the counter, a frown on his
face.</p>
<p>Rowen was a handsome young man with glossy
black hair. He had never been popular with the
cadet body, however, for he continually reminded
everyone of the wealth and prestige of his family.
But he was a very capable cadet and was respected
though not popular. He had been placed in charge
of the commissary department much to his annoyance,
for he considered it beneath him. Rowen was
striving for an officer&rsquo;s commission, and it did not
please him to be &ldquo;dud chucker,&rdquo; as the cadets
called the commissary clerks. All day the endless
routine of passing out uniforms, blouses, hats and
shoes had galled him, and at the present moment
his temper was ragged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the trouble here?&rdquo; Cadet Rowen demanded
crisply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>The clerk who was waiting on Terry turned to
stare at him. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no trouble, Rowen,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>Rowen looked across the counter at Terry. &ldquo;Is
there any trouble, Mr. Mackson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry shook his head gravely. &ldquo;No, Mr. Rowen.
I am simply trying to draw a uniform that will
match my beauty, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rowen frowned more deeply. &ldquo;Have the goodness
to understand, Mr. Mackson, that we are very
busy here, and that such infant&rsquo;s prattle merely
wastes our time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Papa!&rdquo; returned Terry sedately. The
others snickered and Rowen grew angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t be funny, Mackson! That comes
natural to some people, and others work hard all
their lives without ever managing to be really
humorous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry turned to the others back of him. &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo;
he observed, &ldquo;Mr. Rowen has turned
philosopher! Some of you fellows are naturally
funny, ask Mr. Rowen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dull red flush mounted in the other&rsquo;s cheeks.
&ldquo;How long are you going to waste our time?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; exclaimed the redhead. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m
not mistaken, you are wasting your own time!
Here I am, waiting with the patience of an angel
for my uniform, and are you getting it? No, twenty
times no! Don&rsquo;t you know that time wasted can
never be recovered, Mr. Rowen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I do know!&rdquo; Rowen fairly
hissed. &ldquo;I know that you and those Mercer
brothers are too confounded stuck on yourselves!
You are the colonel&rsquo;s own particular pets!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, the Mercer brothers get a tongue
lashing, too!&rdquo; commented a brown-haired, good-looking
youth back of Terry. &ldquo;Brother Don, weep
on my shoulder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cry better outdoors,&rdquo; grinned Don Mercer,
behind his brother Jim. &ldquo;Gee, how distressing this
conversation is getting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are making us feel dreadful, really, Mr.
Rowen!&rdquo; Terry told the clerk mournfully. At the
laugh that went up Rowen lost his temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you feel dreadful, all right,&rdquo; snapped
the disagreeable cadet, and before anyone could
guess as to his purpose he hit Terry on the point
of the jaw, knocking him to the floor.</p>
<p>There was a moment of hushed expectancy
while Terry stared up at the supply clerk in surprise.
Most of the good-natured grin had faded
from his face, and a slight redness had suffused his
cheeks. He jumped to his feet. But at that moment
Colonel Morrell walked into the office.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Colonel Morrell was a little fat man with gray
hair, laughing gray eyes and the air of a real man&rsquo;s
man about him. By the cadet corps he was beloved
greatly, and to a man they respected him thoroughly.
His keen eye swept over the cadets and he
noted that something unusual was in the wind,
but with characteristic rare judgment he made no
comment on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is everything going smoothly?&rdquo; he asked the
nearest clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered the cadet, saluting. The
colonel returned the salute, turned on his heel
and left the room. They heard his footsteps echo
down the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Rowen,&rdquo; murmured Terry. &ldquo;This
is what you need most of all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he seized the unprepared cadet by
the collar, hauling him bodily over the counter.
Rowen was unprepared for the act and flopped
across the boards, his head hanging over the side.
Although he struggled furiously Terry managed
to hold him down while he administered a sound
spanking to the surly one. Then he pushed him
backward. The assembled cadets had enjoyed
every moment of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for you,&rdquo; said Terry, unheeding the
sputtering of the other. &ldquo;If you act like a baby
someone will have to play papa and spank you!
I happened to be the nearest one. Next time be
careful who you punch on the jaw. It might be
somebody who&rsquo;ll lose his temper and muss you
up!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you red-headed calf!&rdquo; cried the enraged
Rowen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve&mdash;I&rsquo;ve half a mind to thrash you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you have half a mind, that means that
your whole mind is busy on the one subject, because
sometimes I think you have only half a mind.
Now, you&rsquo;re wasting my time! One uniform, if
you please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With very bad grace the uniform was handed to
him and the line moved on. As Terry stepped
away Rowen spoke to him between half-shut teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix you for this yet, Mackson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim Mercer halted at the counter. &ldquo;Was there
some complaint about the Mercer brothers,
Rowen?&rdquo; he asked quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just said that you two were the colonel&rsquo;s
pets,&rdquo; replied the clerk. &ldquo;Just because you two
once helped the colonel out of a mess he bows
down before you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all due respect to the colonel,&rdquo; drawled
Don Mercer, &ldquo;he is a little too fat to bow down!
Calm down, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, you guys give me a pain!&rdquo; roared the
clerk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Terry impishly picked up the telephone, carefully
holding down the hook. &ldquo;Hello, is this the
nurse?&rdquo; he spoke into the transmitter. &ldquo;If you
have time I wish you&rsquo;d stop in at the commissary
department. Mr. Rowen has a very bad pain. I
beg your pardon? Oh, it seems to be a Mackson-Mercer
pain, if you know what that is! It seems
to be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laughing, Jim Mercer caught him by the arm.
&ldquo;Come on, get out of here, you!&rdquo; he admonished
his friend. &ldquo;Come on up to the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three boys were devoted pals, having been
friends from childhood. They had been in many
scrapes and adventures together, sharing their fun
and dangers on land and sea. In the first volume
of this series, <i>The Mercer Boys&rsquo; Cruise in the
Lassie</i>, they had gone on a long cruise, and from
there they had come to Woodcrest, their fun and
adventure at that time being related in <i>The Mercer
Boys at Woodcrest</i>. On their following summer
vacation they had encountered some strange events
in <i>The Mercer Boys on a Treasure Hunt</i> and later
on had worked together on a school mystery, details
of which will be found in <i>The Mercer Boys&rsquo;
Mystery Case</i>. Early in the spring of that same
year the boys had faced a man&rsquo;s task on the Massachusetts
coast, all of which will be found in the
fifth volume, <i>The Mercer Boys with the Coast
Guard</i>. Now, after a few months of uneventful
school life, they were preparing for their first encampment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>Once in their own room the three boys hung
up the new uniforms that they would wear the
next day. There were no lessons and they had
nothing to do except wait until morning, when
they would set off for camp. All of the boys looked
forward eagerly to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear that we are going to a new camping
ground this year,&rdquo; Jim said, as he sat on the edge
of his bed. &ldquo;Rustling Ridge, they call it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; nodded Don. &ldquo;Other years they have
held the encampment at Perryville, but the colonel
hunted up new grounds this time. I heard that
there had been quite a bit of building going on
near the old camp and the colonel wants to get as
far away from civilization as he can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rustling Ridge is none too far, at that,&rdquo; observed
Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; agreed Jim. &ldquo;But it is far enough
away for camping purposes. Even the colonel
doesn&rsquo;t know much about this new location.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About thirty miles from here, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Don
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard that it was,&rdquo; returned Terry. &ldquo;Well,
the whole outlook suits me perfectly. I wouldn&rsquo;t
have known what to do with myself this vacation,
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;We might have made a cruise,&rdquo; Don suggested.
&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t been sailing on the good old <i>Lassie</i>
for so long that I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve forgotten how to
manage it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Camping might bring us some good adventures,&rdquo;
Jim put in. Don shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather doubt that. What adventures can we
run across on a camping trip? We&rsquo;ll have a lot of
fun, I grant you that, but I don&rsquo;t look for anything
out of the way. We&rsquo;ll be very busy drilling
and practicing all sorts of tactics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might have some excitement with Mr.
Rowen!&rdquo; Terry grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rowen is a natural sorehead,&rdquo; said Don briefly.
&ldquo;The best thing we can do is to let him alone.
That kind isn&rsquo;t made any better by stirring up,
and he isn&rsquo;t worth getting into trouble over.
We can just be decent to him and let it go at
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; nodded Terry.</p>
<p>Supper that night was a slightly unruly affair,
tempered only by the presence of the colonel and
the other officers. The young soldiers themselves
were in high spirits.</p>
<p>Rowen, after the meal, went into conference
with his two roommates, young men who had borrowed
from the unpopular cadet and, therefore,
felt obligated to him. What went on in that conference
was not designed for Terry Mackson&rsquo;s
peace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>When the orders of the day were read that evening
all cadets were commanded to be in place at
bugle call in the morning, with full equipment
and ready to march. It was announced that no
excuses would be accepted for failure to report on
time.</p>
<p>When the bugle sounded the next morning the
cadets sprang from bed, dressed and ate a hearty
breakfast. There was still half an hour before assembly
and the cadets were at leisure. Just as
Terry was turning away from the table a member
of the kitchen force approached him. In his hand
he had a note.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is for you, Mr. Mackson,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Pete,&rdquo; said Terry, accepting the note.
&ldquo;Who gave it to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack Olson,&rdquo; replied the cook. &ldquo;He said Captain
Rush gave it to him, but he didn&rsquo;t have time
to give it to you himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry nodded and read the note. Captain Rush
was the leader of the artillery division to which
Terry belonged. The note was brief and to the
point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Mackson:</p>
<p>Go to the storage room in the barn and get
out the extra harness that you will find there.</p>
<p><span class="jr"><span class="sc">Rush</span>, Captain.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;Funny he didn&rsquo;t tell me, instead of sending me
a note,&rdquo; reflected Terry. &ldquo;Well, orders are orders,
and I&rsquo;m ready as it is. I&rsquo;ll go out there now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made his way to the barn, finding it quite
empty. He knew that there was a small storage
room at one side and he made his way to it, opening
the door and peering in. There was a pile of
harness on the floor and he went toward it.</p>
<p>At that moment the door back of him closed
with a bang. A bolt on the outside was shot at the
same moment. Terry rushed to the door, pushing
against it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Open this door, whoever
you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His only answer was the sound of retreating
footsteps and the point of it all came to him in a
rush. He kicked against the door, finding it solid
and then looked around the cell. But there was no
window and no opening of any kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tumbled right into the trap!&rdquo; he groaned,
grinding his teeth. &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t get out of here before
assembly it will be too bad for me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<h2 id="c2">2
<br /><span class="small">The &ldquo;Gossip&rdquo; Runs Wild</span></h2>
<p>The whole trick was clear to him now. In the general
orders of the day, read to the cadets on the
previous day, the fact that no excuse would be
accepted had been sternly emphasized. Terry was
not the kind who would carry tales even if he
thought they would excuse him and win him sympathy,
and as he realized how badly fooled he had
been his eyes flashed in anger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see the whole business, now,&rdquo; he reflected.
&ldquo;Jack Olson is a crony of Rowen&rsquo;s and he carried
that note supposedly signed by Rush. They know
I won&rsquo;t tell Rush about it, and there isn&rsquo;t any use
in thumping Olson, because he probably had to
take his orders from Rowen. But I sure would like
my hands on that surly guy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Realizing that every moment counted the red-headed
youth looked around the small room, his
eyes having grown used to the darkness. He hoped
that there might be some instrument that would
make it possible for him to pry up a board and so
make his escape, but the only thing in sight was
the pile of harness. There was not even a piece of
metal on the harness and although he examined
every corner of the little cell he was unable to find
a single object that would aid him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll just have to use my hands and feet,
if that will do any good,&rdquo; he reflected.</p>
<p>Dropping on his hands and knees he examined
the floor carefully to see if any of the boards were
loose, but all of them were securely fastened to the
huge beams that made up the framework of the
barn. The boards were very thick and any thought
of escaping under the barn was out of the question.
From there he went to the door, feeling carefully
along the sides to see if any signs of weakness
existed here, but once again he was disappointed.
Like the rest of the barn the door and the frame
had been strongly constructed and it did not even
quiver under his hearty kicks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;About the only thing I can do&mdash;if I can do it&mdash;is
to kick a board off the side of the wall,&rdquo; he
decided.</p>
<p>With this thought in mind he raised his foot,
but then a sound reached his ears, a sound that
made his blood chill.</p>
<p>With a clarity and snap the call of assembly rang
out on the morning air!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; groaned Terry, the sweat breaking
out on his forehead. &ldquo;There goes the call to
assemble! If I&rsquo;m ever going to get out of here in
time, now is the moment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With desperation Terry kicked stoutly at the
wall boards, but with the first kick the bitter truth
was forced upon him. The sides of the barn were
as strongly composed as the rest of the building,
and all the kicking in the world would not get him
out of the room in which he was held prisoner.
To further worry him certain sounds told him
that the process of assembly was going forward
rapidly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Doors slammed, running footsteps sounded on
the parade grounds, voices rang out as the assembling
cadets gathered. The butt of a rifle cracked
on the pavement, and the noise of stamping horses
reached his ears. The cavalrymen, of which Jim
Mercer was the chief, were leading out the spirited
mounts, and the creaking of leather, the snorts of
the horses, and the cries of the young soldiers,
reached the ears of the unfortunate young cadet.
Hoping to attract their attention he pounded and
yelled at the top of his voice, but no response came
back to him. They were making too much noise
themselves to hear him.</p>
<p>Closer at hand there was a deeper rumble and
Terry groaned in spirit. It was the members of
his own division, the artillery, taking out the field
guns that they were to take with them for the summer
practice. He was the chief gunner on the sleek
steel monster which he had named the &ldquo;Gossip&rdquo;
and he knew that the others of his crew must be
wondering where he was. Just as soon as the guns
were in formation and the roll call sounded he
would be officially marked absent from duty and
held guilty of disobeying orders. As he heard the
guns roll out of the barracks and heard the noise
of the towing cables being connected he knew it
was too late.</p>
<p>From the barracks to the parade ground there
was a slight hill and the trucks began to pull the
weapons up the grade. He heard them go up one
by one and then something seemed to go wrong.
There was a snap, a rumble and somebody cried
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; he heard Captain Rush bellow.
&ldquo;Number One gun is loose!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>That gun was Terry&rsquo;s own piece of equipment.
From the cries that arose he gathered that the gun
had broken from the cable and was rolling down
the hill. There was an increasing rumble that
seemed suddenly close at hand, and before his
brain had time to realize what had happened there
was a tremendous crash, the boards of his cell burst
open like matchwood, and the butt of the &ldquo;Gossip&rdquo;
halted a scant foot from his stomach!</p>
<p>For a single instant Terry was stunned. The
sudden glare of morning sunlight made him blink,
the dust filled his mouth and the echoes of the
crash remained in his ears. But it did not take him
long to regain his composure and spring forward.
He placed affectionate hands on the gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old &lsquo;Gossip,&rsquo;&rdquo; he whooped. &ldquo;You
wouldn&rsquo;t go on parade without me, would you?
Talk about luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half dozen artillerymen appeared at the opening,
led by Captain Rush. At the sight of Terry
they halted and stared in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; Cadet Emerson,
Terry&rsquo;s mate, shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waiting for the old &lsquo;Gossip&rsquo; to let me out!&rdquo;
retorted Terry gleefully.</p>
<p>Rush approached him. &ldquo;Where have you been,
Mr. Mackson?&rdquo; he inquired formally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone locked me in here and I couldn&rsquo;t get
out, captain,&rdquo; returned Terry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then the accident was a lucky one for you,&rdquo;
nodded the captain. He turned to the young artillerymen.
&ldquo;We have only a few minutes to make
the parade grounds. Snap to it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry threw himself into the work, rejoicing in
the chance to be busy. The truck was backed
down the hill and the broken cable was stripped
from it and new material substituted. A loose pin
was driven into the shaft and when the &ldquo;Gossip&rdquo;
was harnessed it was drawn up to the top of the
hill in safety and wheeled swiftly into position.
And on the rear box sat Terry, grinning from ear
to ear.</p>
<p>When his name was called he answered brightly,
stealing a look across the parade ground to the
infantry, where Rowen stood in the second rank.
The face of the sullen one was a study in amazement.</p>
<p>In accordance with previous instructions the
cavalry swung out first, taking the long, dusty road
that led to Rustling Ridge. Next in line marched
the infantry and the artillery rumbled in the rear.
Terry sat on his gun, happy and thankful for the
good fortune he had had. He smiled frequently,
but there was a grim set to his jaw nevertheless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>All through the morning they marched and it
was noon before they paused to make temporary
camp. Just as soon as the long column came to a
halt and broke up Terry made his way to where
Rowen and his few friends sat on a grassy bank.
He halted directly in front of the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t work, did it?&rdquo; Terry asked.</p>
<p>Rowen looked at him with a haughty frown. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you do. Your plan to lock me in the barn
until I was late for camp didn&rsquo;t turn out very well,
did it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about it, and you can&rsquo;t
prove that I do,&rdquo; snapped the dark-haired boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly!&rdquo; growled Terry. &ldquo;I can do that
easily. All I have to do is to give that little sneak
Jack Olson a good, stiff beating and he&rsquo;ll tell. Look
at how pale he is! Or I can ask Captain Rush about
it and we&rsquo;d have you in a fine mess. But I don&rsquo;t
intend to do anything like that, Rowen, and you
know it. I would have been blacklisted by my captain
if I had been late for encampment, and you
figured on that. Now, look here! Just one more
piece of freshness out of you and I&rsquo;ll give you the
peachiest licking you ever saw, right in front of
the cadet corps. Don&rsquo;t forget it, my friend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning on his heel Terry walked off, his eyes
dancing slightly. There was no word spoken by
the ones back of him, and perhaps it was just as
well. The redhead was dynamite and ready to go.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>In that brief period he encountered Don. Jim
was far ahead with the supply corps but Don, who
was a lieutenant in the infantry, was close at hand.
He was delighted to see his pal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where in the world were you at assembly?&rdquo;
Don demanded. &ldquo;Jim and I nearly turned the
building upside down looking for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry explained briefly and Don approved of
his recent charge to Rowen. &ldquo;That fellow certainly
has a grudge against you,&rdquo; said Don. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t
exactly call him a bully, because he isn&rsquo;t big
enough or strong enough, but his surly nature
makes him anything but trustworthy. A fine mess
you would have had if you had been several days
late for encampment. As far as that goes, you
might have been a prisoner in that storage room
for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Terry. &ldquo;And to anyone
who likes to eat as well as I do that would have
meant something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After an afternoon of leisurely marching the
cadets came to an open meadow where the cavalry
and the supply corps had set up tents. Here they
spent the night and the next morning they pushed
on to Rustling Ridge, arriving there about noontime.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Rustling Ridge was a long slope that rose gradually
from a flat meadow. It was in the heart of
delightful country, and here and there solitary
farmhouses could be seen. Close beside the camp
there was a deep swimming hole, which the cadets
welcomed with unrestrained delight. The camp
itself was pitched in a grove about a quarter way
up the slope, the white tents rising in somewhat
irregular lines between the trees. The wide glades
on either side of the camp permitted the creation
of natural centers for the horses and the supply
wagons and guns. By midafternoon the camp was
in first-class order and the tired cadets enjoyed
their first swim in the near-by swimming hole.</p>
<p>After supper large fires were lighted, but the
cadets did not linger long around them. Even before
taps many of them had sought their cots, falling
asleep as soon as they crawled in between their
blankets. Sentries were posted and soon the camp
was quiet except for the stamping of horses and
the tramp of the sentries.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h2 id="c3">3
<br /><span class="small">At Rustling Ridge</span></h2>
<p>The clear, thrilling strains of the bugle made
scores of cadets cordially hate Bugler Howes on
the following morning. Many a young soldier considered
defying orders and sleeping on in peace
and comfort, but wisdom prevailed in the long
run. With a snap and many groans the camp came
to life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, boy!&rdquo; sighed Terry, casting his blankets
to one side. &ldquo;I never felt less like getting up in all
my life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you or Jim should kick,&rdquo; Don
said, as he pulled on his clothes. &ldquo;You two rode
out here but I had to march all the way!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired just the same,&rdquo; said Terry.</p>
<p>Once awake the cadets came alive to the glories
of camp life. A rush was made to the near-by
brook where they washed, and then dressing was
speedily finished. Before long they had fallen in
for inspection, the reading of orders and the march
to breakfast.</p>
<p>A long tent had been erected for meals in bad
weather, but during the clear and warm weather
they were permitted to eat outside around the
kitchen tent.</p>
<p>Before long they were all hard at work. On a
flat plain at the bottom of the hill they were all
required to drill and take routine exercises during
the morning. This took up their time until noon.
Then, in the afternoon, the units took up the
tactics of their own particular division. The infantry
was busy that day with setting up range
targets for practice in the near future. After that
was over they worked steadily fixing the camp.
Tents were made more inviting by the addition
of wooden floors, pegs were put in with a view
toward real strength and service, and trenches
were dug to carry off the rain water when it fell
from the sloping canvas. A permanent kitchen was
constructed and the long tables for the mess tent
were built and put in place. Benches then were
hammered into place along the tables, the wagons
set in proper formation and the camp looked vastly
improved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>The cavalry escaped this task but was busy with
tactics of its own. Under Jim, who was its chief,
it was required to drill and go for a canter across
the country. That used up most of the afternoon
and the sun was beginning to sink when they returned.
At school, during the term, the cavalrymen
got quite a bit of practice, but it was the plan
of the colonel to teach his boys to ride every day
during the encampment, so that they might become
used to having horses under them a good
many hours at a stretch. Many a young man
found himself stiff and sore before the end of the
week.</p>
<p>The artillery was busy with what they called
&ldquo;silent drill.&rdquo; Artillery practice was always pretty
expensive and only during the fall and the last few
weeks of summer encampment did the colonel
allow any firing of the fieldpieces. During the
summer the artillerymen were instructed in the
art of finding the range, wheeling the guns into
position, effectively concealing them from an
enemy, especially an enemy in the air, and tearing
down and rebuilding the guns.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>With all of these activities the first day in camp
sped by with astonishing rapidity. This first day
was different from the ones that followed, for once
the camp was settled the work decreased materially.
So busy had the boys been that there was no
time for a swim or any fun on that initial day of
camp life. A few hardy souls managed to stay
awake and talk and sing songs around the campfires,
but most of the young men stumbled to bed
at the first possible moment.</p>
<p>The three friends had not had much of a chance
to see each other that day, and at night they were
too tired to do much in the way of talking. In
common with many others they sought their beds
before taps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m going to be as tired as this every night
I&rsquo;ll never enjoy this camping trip,&rdquo; Jim grumbled
as he undressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; Don observed. &ldquo;This was an
unusual day for all of us, but we&rsquo;ll get used to it.
With all our outdoor life, this systematic drill,
exercise, and work makes us feel the grind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why we have to take regular exercises.&rdquo;
Terry yawned and stretched out on his cot.
&ldquo;Seems to me that we get enough to keep us physically
fit as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but the kind of routine exercises that we
get help to keep us limbered up,&rdquo; Don returned.
&ldquo;Otherwise, we&rsquo;d get a whole lot of one kind of
training and not much of another. You and I get
plenty of leg and arm exercise but Jim would be
riding all day if he stuck to his particular branch
of the corps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; agreed Terry. &ldquo;Well, I suppose
the colonel and the officers know what we need
most of. If anybody asked me right now, though,
I&rsquo;d say it was sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the second day things came more easily to
the active young soldiers. At first, stiff and sore
muscles cried out in protest and glum faces characterized
the corps. But as the day went on their
hearts cheered and slowly the joy of camping evidenced
itself.</p>
<p>That afternoon they finished drill and maneuvers
at three o&rsquo;clock and from then on the time
was their own. A dozen games of baseball were
quickly organized but most of the boys preferred
to make a rush for the big swimming hole. Before
many minutes a score of the boys splashed in.</p>
<p>One cadet had dropped in first to test the depth
of the stream, and finding that it was up to the
average boy&rsquo;s shoulder at the bank and about ten
feet deep in the center, a number of boys had
dived joyfully in. Don and Terry were among the
first, with Jim following a little later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is a dandy pool,&rdquo; gasped Jim, shaking the
water from his eyes and floating close beside Don.
&ldquo;I like snappy fresh water even better than I do
the salt water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; returned his brother. &ldquo;I like the rush
and the sting of the green sea water. But this woodland
water makes you work to keep afloat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no springboard and the cadets were
diving from the bank. In time this proved disappointing.
As they clambered up the sides, the
water running in streams from their dripping
bathing trunks made the bank muddy and then
dangerously slippery. More than one sloppy fall
plastered a swimmer with mud and caused gleeful
laughter, until a few cadets ran into camp, brought
out some long boards and some thick supports,
and in a very short time a fairly good diving board
had been placed on the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is some improvement,&rdquo; smiled Harry
Douglas, as he tried the board out.</p>
<p>The diving then became general and was enjoyed.
One of the best divers was Dick Rowen. His
summers had been spent largely in summer resorts
where swimming was the principal attraction and
he had become quite expert at it. Knowing that
the eyes of many of his comrades were upon him
Rowen performed a good many fancy dives, all of
which were very well done. Some of the cadets,
with quiet generosity, complimented him upon
his prowess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, diving comes easily to me,&rdquo; answered
Rowen, poising for another, in answer to a word
of praise from a cadet. &ldquo;This is one of my best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He jumped to the springboard, attempted to
turn around and over, but his twist did not work
and his feet slipped. Truth to tell, the cadets were
growing tired of his posing and a delighted shout
went up as he slapped the water with a sound that
echoed over the camp.</p>
<p>Thoroughly angry, Rowen bobbed up out of the
water and scrambled ashore, turning a resentful
ear to the good-natured teasing of his mates. Jim
was the next one to follow Rowen out on the
board, and he prepared for his dive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to give us an exhibition of your best
dive, Jim?&rdquo; Cadet Vench called out, laughing.</p>
<p>Jim grinned. &ldquo;Yes, this is my best,&rdquo; he answered,
and sprang away. But his foot slipped and he hit
the water in the same way that Rowen had. Instantly
a roar of laughter went up and Rowen&rsquo;s
face flushed a dull red.</p>
<p>Jim made his way out of the water. &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t
so good at that,&rdquo; he remarked, as he gained the
bank. Then he came face to face with Rowen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think you&rsquo;re pretty smart, don&rsquo;t you, Mercer?&rdquo;
hissed the cadet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Jim looked surprised. &ldquo;Why, no, not especially.
Not after that dive, anyway. What do you mean,
Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me Dick!&rdquo; snapped Rowen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
only Dick to my friends, and that doesn&rsquo;t include
you. I said you think you&rsquo;re funny because you
ridiculed me in that dive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be silly!&rdquo; retorted Jim. &ldquo;I had no
intention of imitating you, Rowen. My foot honestly
slipped, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you, Mercer,&rdquo; said Rowen, at
a white heat.</p>
<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s pause and the gathered
cadets looked on with interest. Jim&rsquo;s jaw had set
and he thought a moment before replying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Rowen,&rdquo; he said, when he had gained
sufficient control of himself. &ldquo;I want you to understand
one thing. I only joke with a man who is
enough of a man to take a joke. If I were picking
out anyone to have some fun with I wouldn&rsquo;t pick
a sorehead like you. As for my not being a friend
of yours, Rowen, that is your own fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fault!&rdquo; shrilled Rowen, trembling. &ldquo;Jeepers!
Do you think I care that you aren&rsquo;t my friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever you like,&rdquo; nodded Jim, and turned
away. Unheeding the statement that &ldquo;some fellows
made him sick&rdquo; Jim went back into the water,
to enjoy himself and forget Rowen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>That evening the cadets remained up until taps,
which came at nine-thirty. A number of fires
formed convenient places for them to gather and
chat. Just before taps the three friends went to
their tents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t notice Rowen around tonight,&rdquo; remarked
Don, as they began to prepare for bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might have been sulking in his tent,&rdquo; grinned
Terry. &ldquo;Now, the only thing that remains is for
him to pick a fight with you, Don!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I could be as patient as you
two have been,&rdquo; mused Don. &ldquo;I think I should be
tempted to punch his nose for him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; smiled Jim, &ldquo;we were tempted,
all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who took my bayonet?&rdquo; questioned Terry,
suddenly.</p>
<p>All of the cadets, including the artillerymen and
cavalrymen, were required to have guns and
bayonets, and Terry had looked aimlessly at his
equipment, to note that the bayonet was gone. In
a moment Don reported the loss of his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine&rsquo;s gone, too,&rdquo; announced Jim. &ldquo;This
looks funny to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry threw the blankets off his bed. &ldquo;Not under
the covers,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Now, where&mdash;hey!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>He dropped to his knees and looked under the
cot. Then he reached under and brought out his
weapon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look under your cots,&rdquo; he directed. Don and
Jim did so and uttered a sharp cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sticking upright, so that when we lay down
on the bed the point would prod us,&rdquo; Don
growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that explains where Rowen was this evening,&rdquo;
guessed Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, this is going a little too far!&rdquo; cried Jim.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a dangerous trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not especially dangerous,&rdquo; said Don
slowly. &ldquo;The point wasn&rsquo;t in such a position that
it would have actually run into us. But he figured
that we&rsquo;d come in just at taps and jump into bed,
landing on the points with enough force to make
us squirm. The worst part of it all is that we can&rsquo;t
prove who did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From now on,&rdquo; said Terry, his eyes narrowing,
&ldquo;we have got to keep a wary eye on that guy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; nodded Don. &ldquo;I guess he placed all three
bayonets so that one of the disliked boys would be
sure to get it. It would be funny if it had been
me, who so far has done nothing to antagonize
him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I catch him in any funny business I&rsquo;ll sail
right into him,&rdquo; promised Jim, as they replaced
the bayonets in the scabbards.</p>
<p>Taps rang out and the camp quieted down. In
a moment the three boys drifted off to sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<h2 id="c4">4
<br /><span class="small">Strange Tales from the Ridge</span></h2>
<p>Three shots sounded from the east side of the
camp. Almost on top of them three shots sounded
from a point close by.</p>
<p>With the first shots the three friends stirred and
woke up, listening while half asleep. But with the
second three shots they rose up in their beds, wide
awake.</p>
<p>Close at hand the sound of rapidly turning
wheels reached their ears, accompanied by the beat
of horses&rsquo; hoofs. Something metallic bumped and
banged. A voice called out: &ldquo;Corporal of the
guard! Post Number Three!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>The boys jumped from their cots with one accord,
reaching for their clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something wrong with the sentries,&rdquo; cried
Don.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is at Number Three post?&rdquo; asked Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anderson,&rdquo; answered Terry, fumbling with
his shoes.</p>
<p>The camp was in motion. Lights flashed at various
points and voices sounded. Past the tent went
running feet. But the bugle did not sound, so they
knew that it was not a fire or any similar emergency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready. How about you two?&rdquo; Don called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right with you,&rdquo; was the response and the
three soldiers burst out of the tent.</p>
<p>A central fire was burning and at this point the
colonel was standing, half-clad and with mussed-up
hair, his eyes heavy with sleep. The other cadets
were clustering around him there, and the sentries
were straggling in to that center. Just as the three
boys reached the spot the sentries from Number
Three and Number Four posts came up and
saluted.</p>
<p>Number Three post was at a point up the Ridge
and Number Four was right at the edge of camp.
The shots from Number Four had followed so
closely to those from Number Three that they
knew the same thing had caused both signals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sentries to report, sir,&rdquo; announced the corporal
of the guard, saluting.</p>
<p>The colonel saluted and faced the sentries.
&ldquo;Make your report, gentlemen,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>Anderson, from Number Three post spoke
up. &ldquo;While patrolling my post I heard a wagon
coming along that dirt road just above the camp on
the Ridge. It appeared to be coming at a great rate
of speed and just as it reached a point above my
post it left the road and cut right down through
the bushes toward me. It had a man and a boy in
it and I challenged them, but without slacking
speed a single bit the wagon tore right past me
toward the camp. I then fired the shots to warn
the camp and the next sentry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; nodded the colonel. &ldquo;Mr. Simms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard the shots, though I had heard the
thrashing of the wagon previously,&rdquo; spoke up the
second sentry. &ldquo;I turned to find the wagon bearing
down on me, swinging from side to side, and with
a man and boy hanging onto the seat. It cut
straight across the lower end of the camp grounds,
down the slope and across the drill grounds.
I fired to bear out Mr. Anderson.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the colonel, with
a puzzled frown on his forehead. In the momentary
silence that followed they could hear the
mysterious wagon bumping and banging across
the country, apparently at top speed.</p>
<p>Now that the official reports had been given the
talk became general. The incident was extremely
puzzling. Both sentries remarked that the man and
boy had been huddled together much as though
pretty badly frightened, and the sight of the cadets
with guns had not seemed to reassure them any.
Neither sentry had been able to see what had been
in the wagon because it had passed them in too
great a hurry, but from the sound they judged the
rattling was caused by pots and pans. A single
horse had pulled the cart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strangest thing I ever heard of,&rdquo; murmured
the new senior captain, Henry Jordan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t figure out why the party in the wagon
left the dirt road,&rdquo; said the colonel to Major
Rhodes, the drill instructor. &ldquo;That road runs
parallel with the Ridge and works gradually down
to the level of the countryside. For some reason
or other that pair in the wagon wanted to get off
the Ridge and out on the open meadow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is possible that they were fleeing from some
crime,&rdquo; suggested Rhodes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;True enough,&rdquo; assented the colonel. &ldquo;And
when they saw the cadets the vision didn&rsquo;t reassure
them any. Well, it goes beyond my understanding.&rdquo;
He turned once more to the attentive
soldiers. &ldquo;Corporal of the guard, restation the sentries.
Everyone back to his bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sentries were reposted and the other cadets
straggled back to their cots. Once in their tent Jim
looked at his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A quarter past three,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Quite
an uncanny hour out here in the country. I&rsquo;ll bet
there is something behind that wild wagon flight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny they should cut right across the camp,&rdquo;
remarked Don.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with Rhodes that those fellows were
probably fleeing from something like a crime,&rdquo;
advanced Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be the explanation,&rdquo; agreed Don.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of any other reason for such a wild
flight. Well, me for some more sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rest of that night was quiet and in the
morning the cadets discussed the event further.
The details of the day then took up all of their
attention and the night adventure was pushed
from their minds.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon Don and Terry hastened
into the tent to get their baseball gloves. Jim was
in the tent at the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to play some ball?&rdquo; Terry hailed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Jim shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m out of luck today,&rdquo;
he announced. &ldquo;Six of us have to go to a near-by
farmhouse and buy some eggs and butter. The
colonel told me to try and strike a bargain with a
farmer for eggs, butter, milk and meat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to wait for your change after you
pay the farmer!&rdquo; advised Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go chase yourself!&rdquo; flung back Jim. &ldquo;I guess
I know enough for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the other two went off to play ball Jim
rounded up his five companions and they set off
on horseback for the farmhouses that lay scattered
over the Ridge. Two of the farms they passed did
not look very promising but at last they came to
a neat-looking one which had a large sign on the
front fence. This sign announced that chickens,
eggs and butter were on sale and into this yard
the six cavalrymen turned their horses. An uproar
of barking dogs announced their presence
and a farmer appeared, scanning their uniforms
with great interest. To him Jim explained their
errand.</p>
<p>The farmer was more than pleased and hastened
to bring out several dozen fresh eggs and a dozen
pounds of butter. In the meantime some children
and two farmhands had gathered about the soldiers,
staring at them curiously. When the supplies
had been paid for Jim asked the farmer to
come to camp and confer with the colonel concerning
future food supplies. The farmer was delighted
beyond words.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;You bet your boots I&rsquo;ll come down,&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;Business is mighty poor, and this is a big boost to
me. My name&rsquo;s Carson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little boy named Jimmie was particularly interested
in the cadets, and they took an instant
liking to him. He was a bright and sturdy little
boy, and some of the cadets invited him to visit
the camp, an invitation which he willingly accepted.</p>
<p>Just before they rode off the farmer spoke to
Jim. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t see nothing of the ghost, have you?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>Jim shook his head. &ldquo;No. Have you one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The farmer nodded solemnly. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you
heard about the ghost of Rustling Ridge?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; laughed Lieutenant Thompson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a sure-enough ghost that prowls this
Ridge,&rdquo; said the farmer, gravely. &ldquo;Every once in
a while it walks and scares people half to death.
More than one family&rsquo;s up and moved away just
on account of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far we haven&rsquo;t been lucky enough to see
him,&rdquo; returned Jim, distributing the packages.
&ldquo;If we do, we&rsquo;ll try and take him apart and look
at him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>The farmer shook his head. &ldquo;Very bad business,
that ghost. Look out he doesn&rsquo;t turn up in
your camp some night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With more jests about the ghost the cadets
swung out of the yard and headed back toward
camp, carrying their packages carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So there is a ghost on the Ridge, is there?&rdquo;
Thompson said to Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not greatly surprised,&rdquo; Jim said. &ldquo;Most of
these country places have room for at least one
good ghost. They wouldn&rsquo;t be quite happy if they
didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colonel was pleased at their success and
planned to buy more things from the farmer in
the future. The provisions, with the exception of
the canned goods which they had brought with
them from school, had been all used up, for the
invigorating outdoor life gave all the cadets ravenous
appetites.</p>
<p>The cadets had been asleep perhaps two hours
that night when a medley of shots rang out from
post Number One, deep in the woods. As on the
previous night the three boys hopped out of bed
immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly, this is getting to be an epidemic,&rdquo;
snorted Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this must be something different,&rdquo; remarked
Don. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hear any wagon crashing
through the bushes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any more shots, either,&rdquo; mentioned
Jim.</p>
<p>Once outside the corporal of the guard brought
in Douglas from the post. The colonel asked for
a report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While standing at my post I saw a white shape
pass me about ten yards away!&rdquo; was Harry&rsquo;s startling
statement. &ldquo;I challenged it, but it just glided
on past me. At my shots it flashed into the trees
and was gone. I was unable to find any trace
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A shape, Mr. Douglas?&rdquo; frowned the colonel.
&ldquo;What sort of a shape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it looked like someone in a sheet,&rdquo; explained
Douglas. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t see any head on the
object, and it seemed to glide along the ground!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm, our ghost of the Ridge!&rdquo; said Jim to
Thompson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that, Mr. Mercer?&rdquo; the colonel cried,
alertly.</p>
<p>Jim explained the story which the farmer had
told to them that afternoon. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t say anything
about it, because we put it down for a lot
of nonsense,&rdquo; he wound up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; replied the colonel. &ldquo;Captains and lieutenants
go to post Number One and look around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others waited a long half-hour until the
officers came back. There was no news.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;We found no traces of anything,&rdquo; Senior Captain
Jordan reported.</p>
<p>Puzzled over the events of the past two nights
the colonel ordered the boys back to bed. It was
a long time before a good many of them fell asleep.
In their own tent the three pals talked quietly of
the situation, but could not puzzle it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this business doesn&rsquo;t stop pretty soon,&rdquo; Terry
concluded the talk, &ldquo;we won&rsquo;t get enough sleep on
this camping trip!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<h2 id="c5">5
<br /><span class="small">A Fight and a Stampede</span></h2>
<p>Captain Jim made his way around the last of the
tents that formed the A Company row and then
paused. With a motion that combined speed with
caution he stepped out of sight behind the slope
of the tent, his eyes narrowed, senses alert.</p>
<p>He was on his way to the section of the camp
allotted to the cavalry horses. It was midafternoon
and active drill was over for the day. Most of the
young soldiers were in swimming, a few played
baseball out in the blazing sun, and a few with less
energy lay in the shade. Jim had dismounted
rather hurriedly to make a report and he was on
his way to see that the cadet orderlies had properly
taken care of his horse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>The horses were just before him at the present
moment, a score or more of restless, high-strung
mounts. No orderly or cavalryman was with them
at the moment and no one save one cadet could
be seen. This cadet was acting queerly, and Jim&rsquo;s
attention was the more quickly attracted when he
saw that the lone cadet was Dick Rowen.</p>
<p>Rowen&rsquo;s campaign hat was in his crooked arm
and he was standing directly in front of Jim&rsquo;s
horse, Squall. From time to time Rowen looked
furtively around the camp to see if anyone was
observing him, but he failed to see the cavalry
captain. The lone cadet dipped his hand into the
hat and extended something to the horse. Squall
appeared to reach out eagerly for whatever it was
each time, but the neck of another horse obscured
from Jim what it was that Rowen was feeding his
horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what the dickens can that fellow be doing?&rdquo;
Jim puzzled. &ldquo;He seems to be unusually kind
to my horse, and it looks suspicious to me. Of
course, it is possible that Rowen likes horses and
is feeding them, but he knows that one is mine.
Maybe he doesn&rsquo;t carry his grudges as far as the
animals!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>One of the objects that Rowen was feeding to
the horse dropped to the ground, rolling a short
distance. As soon as Jim recognized it he became
indignant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A green apple! A lot he knows about horses! If
he wants to be kind to them he should pick something
else beside&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped short in his thought. Rowen looked
right and left again and then moved off a few paces
to the left, reaching down for a bucket of water.
With this in his hand he walked back to the horse,
raised it to his eager lips, and tilted the bucket.</p>
<p>Jim Mercer waited to see no more. The whole
cowardly trick was plain to him now. Each cavalryman
was required to keep his mount in perfect
condition and no excuse would be accepted for
failure to do so. He could picture Squall after his
meal of green apples and his drink of cold water,
rolling in agony for hours, and himself severely
blamed for criminal neglect. The boy&rsquo;s eyes blazed
in fury as he hurled himself in Rowen&rsquo;s direction.</p>
<p>He was on top of the boy before Rowen was
aware of him. Rowen turned startled eyes in his
direction, his face paling swiftly. The tongue of
the horse had just touched the water&rsquo;s surface
when Jim landed his fist with all his force on the
cheek of the cadet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Rowen went down promptly, the bucket of
water spilling all over his uniform. A dull red spot
showed where Jim&rsquo;s fist landed, and Rowen rolled
over with a faint bleat. With bulging eyes he
looked up to where Jim towered over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you contemptible, sneaking coward!&rdquo;
Jim, his voice trembling, exploded with emotion.
&ldquo;You intended to bloat my horse so that I would
do &lsquo;growl duty&rsquo; for neglect, did you? How about
the hours of agony that the horse would suffer?
Did you think of that? Get on your feet, because
I&rsquo;m going to thrash you until you won&rsquo;t be able to
walk for the rest of the summer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you lay your hands on me, Mercer, I&rsquo;ll report
you to the colonel,&rdquo; cried Rowen, cowed at
Jim&rsquo;s attitude. The captain was ablaze with wrath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the colonel all you want to, but I&rsquo;m going
to put you in the infirmary for a month,&rdquo; promised
Jim, reaching for the collar of the fallen cadet.</p>
<p>At that moment Terry, Jordan, Don and Vench
came around the end of the tent row. They had
been playing ball and were on their way to change
clothes for a swim. They saw the two before them
and hurried over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, gentlemen,&rdquo; commanded Jordan,
briskly. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t fight in camp. What&rsquo;s the row,
anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercer knocked me down,&rdquo; complained
Rowen, while Don pulled Jim away. Don was surprised
to feel how violently Jim was trembling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you knock Rowen down, Mercer?&rdquo;
Jordan asked.</p>
<p>Jim did not in the least mind Jordan&rsquo;s commanding
tone. Although they were both captains
of divisions, and Jim was therefore an equal as
an officer, Jordan nevertheless claimed a slight
privilege as the senior captain of the school. In the
following year, their last one at Woodcrest, Jim
would be senior captain of the cavalry, with the
unusual record of having held that post for three
years. His heroism at Hill 31, when he rescued
Vench, had won him that rank. But in the final
year Don would be promoted from the infantry
lieutenant to Senior Cadet Captain of the Corps,
thus ranking a step higher than Jim, for all the
latter&rsquo;s three years of captaincy in the cavalry.</p>
<p>Jim readily related the story of the short fight.
He felt that the action was so cowardly and sneaking
that Rowen did not deserve to have it hushed
up. The faces of the cadets described their feelings
as the story was told. Rowen turned white to red-faced
as he saw the looks cast in his direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care so much about the punishment I
would have received,&rdquo; Jim said in conclusion,
&ldquo;but how any guy in the world with a grain of
common decency in him would stoop to give a
horse hours of agony is more than I can see. You
fellows can see the evidences of his guilt on the
ground, the pail and the apple. When you came
along I was about to give him the biggest licking
he ever got in his life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up, Rowen!&rdquo; commanded the senior captain,
sternly. &ldquo;We are not on duty, or I&rsquo;d put up
with this trick just long enough to order you under
arrest! I don&rsquo;t mind telling you frankly that
you won&rsquo;t last long enough in the corps to ever
graduate if this story gets out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a hang about the corps!&rdquo; snapped
Rowen. &ldquo;How about Mercer here? Don&rsquo;t forget
that he struck me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t forget him for doing it, instead I will
remember him gratefully for doing it. Perhaps
it was too bad that we arrived just as we did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rowen looked up at Jordan shamefaced yet still
belligerent. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get even with you boys! Just wait
and see. And you can&rsquo;t prove I harmed your old
horse, either, Mercer.&rdquo; With these remarks,
Rowen turned on his heel and strode away, his
chin high in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! How do you like that?&rdquo; Terry exclaimed.
&ldquo;He sure has some nerve carrying a grudge after
what&rsquo;s happened just now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I had met up with a lot of the mean,
tricky people!&rdquo; exclaimed Jordan. &ldquo;But that beats
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the horse, Jim?&rdquo; Don asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to duck over to the canteen and get
out some of the horse medicine and then run him
around until he gets over the effects of the green
apples,&rdquo; replied the cavalry captain. &ldquo;No water for
you, Squall old boy, until you have lost the effects
of your unexpected meal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Jim was looking after the horse the others
walked over to the tents, talking the matter over.
All of them were deeply upset by the total unjustness
of it all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just because Jim slipped on the springboard
and made a dive like Rowen&rsquo;s!&rdquo; said Vench. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t understand some fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; replied Don, slowly. &ldquo;For
a long time Rowen has had a grouch against all of
us; for no particular reason at all. He&rsquo;s the kind
of boy who just seems to have trouble wherever he
goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not until they were preparing for bed
that evening that the three boys had an opportunity
to further discuss the afternoon&rsquo;s incident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your horse OK?&rdquo; Terry asked, kicking off
his shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jim answered. &ldquo;As long as he didn&rsquo;t get
a big drink of water he&mdash;Oh, golly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; the other two asked,
aroused at the dismay in Jim&rsquo;s tone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost my belt,&rdquo; Jim returned. &ldquo;I had it on
when I went to the corral, and I guess I must have
dropped it there. I&rsquo;ll have to go back and find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to have it for inspection tomorrow,&rdquo;
said Don. &ldquo;Wait a shake, and I&rsquo;ll go back with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; vetoed Jim. &ldquo;I can sneak out
myself and make the trip in record time. No use
in running the risk of having you reported with
me. Douglas is patrolling post Number Five and
I can slip through him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but the guard will have been changed by
the time you get back,&rdquo; Terry reminded him.
&ldquo;Then what are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just have to take my chances and slip
through while he is at the far end of the patrol,&rdquo;
replied Jim, putting his shirt on again. &ldquo;I should
have seen to it that I didn&rsquo;t drop my belt, that&rsquo;s
all. You fellows go to sleep, and I&rsquo;ll soon be back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; agreed Don. &ldquo;Good luck, kid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; murmured Jim, looking carefully
from the flap of the tent. &ldquo;See you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he was gone, slipping back of the
tents and keeping well in the shadows. At the edge
of the camp he waited until he saw Douglas standing
with his back toward him. Then Jim slipped
by him and plunged into the woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take him long to reach the spot where
the horses were corralled and after a little hunting
he found his belt. It had dropped close to the foot
of a clump of bushes and was out of the direct rays
of the moon. Buckling it around his waist Jim
began his return journey to the camp.</p>
<p>But now, as he approached the place, he became
very cautious. He must trust to luck to slip past
the man at the post and it would be no easy task.</p>
<p>He decided that perhaps by flitting along past
the animals he could more easily gain the corner
of the nearest company street and by lying on his
stomach in the shadow of a tent he could escape
the eyes of the cadet until it was safe to move on.
With this thought in mind Jim moved to the
horses and then paused.</p>
<p>There was a tall white shape close to the animals,
and they had sensed the presence of the
thing. It looked to be a very tall man shrouded in
white, and he was at the moment near the foremost
horses. Forgetting his unusual position Jim
rushed forward to see what was going on.</p>
<p>The shape before him heard his quick step,
turned toward him, and then moved with an agility
that astonished the cadet captain. Slapping the
flanks of the horses right and left the man in white
started them moving. Jim jumped forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, you!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What are you doing to
those horses?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>The figure in white took to the trees swiftly and
Jim was unable to stop him. For the horses, frightened
by something, perhaps the white shape itself,
moved with increasing speed out of the corral.
Before Jim could call to them it had developed
into a wild stampede, and the horses were headed
like a cyclone for the nearest tents.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<h2 id="c6">6
<br /><span class="small">The Trouble Bug Bites Deep</span></h2>
<p>After that, things happened rapidly. Just as the
horses began their rapid flight the sentry on the
post rushed up to Jim. As luck would have it, it
was none other than Rowen.</p>
<p>Before he could say anything the stampeding
horses hit the first tents. They had spread out fan-wise
on their wild run, and those on the wings
were unable to push into the company streets.
Blindly they crashed into the tents, taking two of
them down in a flash and tipping a third over. The
thunder of hoofs, the ripping of tent cords and the
shouts of bewildered cadets buried under the entangling
canvas turned the peaceful camp into a
raging scene of chaos.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Cadets at the further end of the camp ran out,
only to meet the galloping horses face to face. They
were too bewildered to comprehend at once just
what was going on, but they scurried back under
cover. There was a vast uproar on all sides. A
cloud of dust rose over the camp, partially obscuring
the moon. To add to the confusion the sentries
on other posts excitedly fired their guns.</p>
<p>Jim stood confused, wiping the dust from his
eyes impatiently. Close beside him stood Rowen,
coughing violently from the dust that the horses
had raised. When he could speak he turned to Jim
sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here, Mercer?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went back to the corral for my belt and then
I saw a white shape near the horses,&rdquo; related Jim.
&ldquo;Just as I challenged him he slapped them on the
flank, starting the stampede.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rowen looked around the near-by woods. There
was nothing to be seen. Deliberately he faced Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absurd, Mercer,&rdquo; he declared, his intention
plain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean you think I&rsquo;m lying?&rdquo; Jim demanded,
his cheeks flushing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to mean anything. You tell me a
story like that but I don&rsquo;t see the faintest evidence
of it. What do you expect of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Rowen,&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;How far away
were you when these horses started?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few yards. I was just patrolling this way
when I heard them go,&rdquo; answered the sentry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you heard me say, &lsquo;What are you doing
to those horses?&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mercer, I did not,&rdquo; returned Rowen,
steadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did so!&rdquo; retorted Jim, flatly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard nothing,&rdquo; repeated Rowen. &ldquo;When I
got here I found the horses in flight and I saw you
standing back of them. Under the circumstances I
must tell that to the proper officers and the
colonel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly you must. But I will also tell them
about the white shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they will be a little more inclined to believe
you than I am,&rdquo; sneered Rowen.</p>
<p>Jim took a step forward. &ldquo;Rowen, if you intimate
that I lie, I&rsquo;ll surely thrash you worse than
I did this afternoon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercer, in addition to reporting you for stampeding
the horses, I shall also report you for threatening
the sentry while he was performing his
duty,&rdquo; followed up the vengeful cadet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>Hot words leaped to Jim&rsquo;s lips, but he stopped
them. More words would lead to trouble, and he
was sure that he had enough of that on his hands
right now to last him for some time. Beside that,
the camp was a bedlam and the horses were scattered
all over the meadow below. Outwardly cool
he faced the sentry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to help round up the horses,&rdquo; he
told Rowen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this Jim turned and ran across the camp,
heading down the slope to the field below. The
colonel was now on the job, with some realization
of what had occurred. A detail of cadets was busy
at the fallen tents, lifting the canvas and helping
the stunned soldiers out into the open. One boy
had had his shoulder sprained but that was all the
physical damage there was. Most of the horses had
halted on the plain below and were quietly cropping
the grass.</p>
<p>All of the cavalrymen turned instinctively toward
the horses and were now engaged in the difficult
job of trying to secure them. The infantrymen
and artillerymen stood around talking things over,
understanding that there had been a stampede
but not fully realizing why the horses had run
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess something just scared them and they
bolted,&rdquo; Cadet Douglas said, speaking to a group.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know where Jim is?&rdquo; murmured
Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad it had to happen while he was out of
the camp,&rdquo; returned Don, in a low voice. &ldquo;If the
colonel ever learns that he was absent at the time
he&rsquo;ll have a job explaining where he was. If he
doesn&rsquo;t turn up and go hunting the horses he&rsquo;ll
have to answer for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drill Master Rhodes bore down on the assembled
cadets. &ldquo;A few fires to be lighted, please,&rdquo; he
directed briskly. At this word the cadets scattered
and fell to work gathering fuel for fires. A short
time later a half-dozen fires lighted up the sky
and threw the camp into bright relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Jim!&rdquo; cried Don, pulling at Terry&rsquo;s
sleeve. &ldquo;He has been right on the job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim was riding Squall bareback and driving
other horses before him. Lieutenant Thompson
brought in others, and the main band of the animals
had been captured. But there were now at
least five horses that had run far off and some of
the cadets saddled and went after them.</p>
<p>This time they found real work cut out for
them. The horses that had run the farthest away
were the unruly ones. They objected strongly to
being captured and led the cadets a merry chase.
After an hour of hard work all but one horse had
been captured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mercer,&rdquo; called the colonel. &ldquo;Take Mr.
Thompson and get that one stray horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim and Thompson mounted and dashed across
the field toward Twinkletoes, the stubborn cavalry
horse. The animal, a beautiful chestnut stallion,
tossed his head disdainfully and trotted off
in a sweeping circle, seeming to enjoy the chase
keenly. He was moving away from the camp and
Jim saw that unless he could get on the far side
of the horse he would lose him. Accordingly, he
abandoned the direct chase, heading Squall out
across the moonlit field until he had passed the
cavorting horse. Then Jim swung sharply in toward
the camp, the animal now in front of him.
Thompson stopped and allowed Twinkletoes to
retreat past him, and then the two cavalry officers
began a chase that entertained and delighted the
camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>Twinkletoes tried in vain to dodge out of the
circle which the two young soldiers had drawn
around him, and it took all of their skill to keep
him from attaining his objective. Twinkletoes
raced and plunged, first toward one side and then
toward the other, making short, mad little dashes,
but as fast as he dashed the officers dashed after
him. In this fashion, working ever in toward the
slope, the two cadets drove the frisky animal in
far enough to make escape possible only by dashing
up the hill. This Twinkletoes refused to do,
and Jim, staking all on a last desperate drive,
forced Squall up beside the fugitive horse and secured
him. As he led him into camp a cheer went
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good work, men,&rdquo; nodded the colonel.</p>
<p>The horses were now all in and the work of
securing them firmly went on. No recall was
sounded and the cadets wandered aimlessly around
the camp. When Jim and the other cavalrymen
returned to the central fire they found the colonel
standing there, surrounded by the instructors
and most of the cadets. Jim was walking toward
the colonel to make his report when Rowen
stepped from the group, triumph written on his
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mercer!&rdquo; he called, loudly. All of the assembled
soldiers, including the colonel, turned to
look at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Mr. Rowen?&rdquo; Jim asked, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will kindly consider yourself under arrest
for starting the stampede!&rdquo; continued Rowen, still
in the loud voice.</p>
<p>His words produced a decided sensation. The
colonel looked particularly astonished. Terry
groaned and nudged Don.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about that! Jim started
the stampede!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mercer, did you start the stampede?&rdquo; the
colonel asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied Jim, promptly.</p>
<p>The colonel turned to Rowen. &ldquo;What is your
exact charge against Captain Mercer, Mr. Rowen?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I charge Captain Mercer with being absent
from camp without official leave, of stampeding
the horses, and of threatening a sentry in the performance
of his duty!&rdquo; cried Rowen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are very serious charges, Captain Mercer,&rdquo;
the colonel told Jim. &ldquo;What have you to say
to them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I admit being out of camp without leave, but
refuse to acknowledge stampeding the horses or
having been in any way responsible for their
breaking loose. I did threaten to thrash Mr. Rowen
because he insisted that I was deliberately lying
when I informed him that a figure clothed entirely
in white slapped the horses and started them on
their stampede,&rdquo; reported Jim. There was a stir
of eager interest from the cadets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A figure in white?&rdquo; said the colonel, sharply.
&ldquo;What was that, Captain Mercer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know, sir,&rdquo; replied Jim. &ldquo;I challenged
him sharply and at the sound of my voice he
slapped the horses on the flanks, starting them on
their break.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Mercer says he called out to the figure
in white,&rdquo; said the colonel, turning to Rowen.
&ldquo;Did you hear him call, Mr. Rowen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not, sir,&rdquo; answered the sentry. &ldquo;Colonel
Morrell, Captain Mercer did not call out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Limit your statement to the fact that you did
not hear him, Mr. Rowen,&rdquo; advised the colonel.
Rowen flushed and trembled with rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you really saw a white shape at the horses,
Captain Mercer? This talk of ghosts has not influenced
you any, has it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit, sir,&rdquo; affirmed Jim, gravely. &ldquo;I distinctly
heard the sharp sounds of his slaps and as
I started for him he glided into the woods close
at hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see anything, Mr. Rowen?&rdquo; the colonel
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only thing I saw was Mr. Mercer standing
there, watching the horses tear across the camp,
sir,&rdquo; answered Rowen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>The colonel thought for a moment. &ldquo;Very well,
men,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;I will consider the case carefully.
Captain Mercer, you will consider yourself
at least temporarily under arrest, on the two
charges preferred by Mr. Rowen, namely, for being
absent without official leave and for threatening
the sentry, although I realize that you threatened
Mr. Rowen not for ordering your arrest, but
for doubting your word. All these things don&rsquo;t go
well with an officer&rsquo;s commission, Captain Mercer,
and I shall be compelled to look into the
entire affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; responded Jim, saluting.</p>
<p>The cadets were sent back to their cots and soon
quiet settled over the entire camp. In their tent
Jim, Terry and Don discussed the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just your luck to run right into Rowen,&rdquo; commented
Terry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to bet my last nickel that
he heard you call out, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that he did, but we can&rsquo;t prove it,&rdquo;
sighed Jim. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not going to worry about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t need to,&rdquo; reassured Don. &ldquo;The
colonel will see to it that you have the proper justice.
Your word is as good as Rowen&rsquo;s and he will
find out the truth some way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<h2 id="c7">7
<br /><span class="small">The Old Man of the Ridge</span></h2>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s punishment did not last long. A circumstance
came up that made the colonel suspend
judgment for some time.</p>
<p>One morning, soon after the incidents related,
a man in a battered old car drove up to the camp.
He was a minister who preached in a regular circuit
of county churches and he was known to the
colonel. The headmaster received him with great
pleasure and the two men talked of many things
as they sat in the colonel&rsquo;s tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said the Reverend Mr. Powers,
after a time. &ldquo;Did someone go past your camp very
hurriedly a few nights ago?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>The colonel showed signs of unusual interest.
&ldquo;Why, yes, a few nights ago a wagon with two men
in it tore right through the camp,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We
couldn&rsquo;t stop it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a man and a boy in it,&rdquo; corrected
the pastor. &ldquo;Well, then you don&rsquo;t know what sent
them flying past you like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; confessed the colonel. &ldquo;If you had seen
the way they flew by, you wouldn&rsquo;t wonder that I
didn&rsquo;t learn anything about them. But tell me
what you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, I would like to ask you a question. Have
you heard anything about a ghost of the Ridge,
since you have been here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colonel snorted. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard much
about anything else,&rdquo; he retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ghost scared these two off. The father is
a farmer who came down here from Pennsylvania.
As it turns out, he is very superstitious, and
the very first night on his own farm, while driving
into the yard with his only son, he saw the white
shape skulking along near his barn. He was just
about crazed with fear and fled to the valley, passing
your camp as he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course this ghost is simply some would-be
humorous person who is having some fun,&rdquo; was
the colonel&rsquo;s opinion. But Mr. Powers had another
opinion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt that very much, Morrell. The thing
has been going on for years and some very good
citizens have given up their homes just on account
of it. The joke would have worn out years ago.
No, I&rsquo;m inclined to think that there is something
deeper in it than mere fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some determined effort should be made to
drive the ghost from the Ridge,&rdquo; grumbled the
headmaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is to start it?&rdquo; shrugged the parson. &ldquo;No
one seems to want to and the sheriff of the county
simply laughs at the whole business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a result of this talk the colonel called Rowen
and Jim into his tent after drill that very afternoon.
They faced him expectantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said the colonel. Then he paused,
and a frown swept over his face. &ldquo;I call you gentlemen,
and will continue to do so until one of you
is proved guilty of deliberate lying. Your conflicting
stories show that one of your statements, coming
from one or the other of you, is a deliberate
falsehood. But to get back to the business in hand:
I have just heard some more tales concerning this
ghost of the Ridge, and in view of it I have decided
to drop the suspension against Captain Mercer.
The word of one of you is as good to me as
the word of the other, and until I prove that one
of you is trying to conceal anything I must consider
the case dismissed until further notice. Mr.
Rowen, you say you did not hear Mr. Mercer call
out nor did you see the white shape. But on the
other hand, Captain Mercer did tell you immediately
that he had seen a white shape, and that
the ghost&mdash;or whatever it was&mdash;had started the
stampede. Inasmuch as you did not see Captain
Mercer start the stampede, and you doubted his
word, I shall be able to hold him only on the
count of being absent without official leave. For
that Captain Mercer will receive demerits. It that
all clear, and satisfactory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much so, to me, sir,&rdquo; approved Jim.
Rowen muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that, Mr. Rowen?&rdquo; the colonel asked,
sharply.</p>
<p>Rowen lost his temper in his sudden fright. &ldquo;I
simply said that of course a Mercer would get the
breaks, sir!&rdquo; he sneered. Then, realizing the slip
he had made, his face turned white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; murmured the colonel. His eyes flashed
but his voice was calm. &ldquo;I asked you if my decision
was satisfactory, Mr. Rowen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; murmured the disappointed cadet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. You are both dismissed,&rdquo; nodded
the colonel. Left alone, his brain worked busily.
He saw a good many things in a clear light now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;Petty jealousy, and he is trying to revenge himself
on Mercer,&rdquo; thought the little colonel. &ldquo;I
guess I can pretty well tell which one of those
young men is lying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the following morning, when the Orders of
the Day were read, Jim and his friends were delighted
to hear in the crisp voice of the battalion
orderly that the charges brought against Captain
Mercer by Sentry Rowen were to be temporarily
dismissed, with the exception of the charge of
leaving camp unofficially, for which Captain Mercer
was to receive twenty-five demerits.</p>
<p>A hundred demerits were sufficient to send a
man home from the encampment and two hundred
at school would dismiss any cadet permanently.</p>
<p>That afternoon there was a partial holiday and
the cadets set out to enjoy themselves. It was a
mild and warm afternoon, with a fleecy sky overhead,
through which the sun peeped at intervals.
Don and Jim sat in the tent, trying to decide just
what to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say to a hike over the Ridge, a
sort of exploring trip?&rdquo; was Don&rsquo;s suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds good,&rdquo; approved Jim. &ldquo;Who can we
get to go along with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll scout around and find out,&rdquo; announced
Don, getting up from his cot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>After looking up their most intimate friends
they found that only Terry and Raoul Vench
cared to go tramping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be glad to go along,&rdquo; yawned the redhead.
He and Raoul had been idly watching the
swimmers when Jim and Don found them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
weary o&rsquo; doing nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too lazy to do anything but watch the other
fellows swim around and enjoy themselves, is that
it?&rdquo; inquired Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you see, I enjoy it that way,&rdquo; returned
Terry, seriously. &ldquo;I have a vivid imagination and
in time, by concentrating on the swimmers, I too
feel the cool of the water and the exhilaration of
the exercise. Just requires a little imaginative concentration,
Jimmie my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a wonderful fellow,&rdquo; glowed Jim. &ldquo;Just
you imagine me a couple of ice-cream sodas, will
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pay me first!&rdquo; grinned Terry. &ldquo;Money back if
I fail to come across.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The four cadets set out at a brisk pace up the
slope of the Ridge. It was heavily wooded and
every now and then they came across a clearing
in which a farmhouse could be seen. They were
not long in reaching the very top of the series
of hills called Rustling Ridge and they paused to
look down into the opposite valley from the one
above which their camp was pitched.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nice picture,&rdquo; observed Terry. &ldquo;Why do they
call this place Rustling Ridge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the fall, when the wind blows hard, the
leaves rustle, and from that fact comes the name,&rdquo;
Don volunteered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you learn that?&rdquo; Vench wanted to
know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked a farm boy who was watching us play
baseball the other day,&rdquo; replied the infantry lieutenant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that old house up there,&rdquo; called out
Jim, pointing to a huge square structure that
showed a battered roof with leaning chimneys over
the tops of the trees. &ldquo;Looks like a fitting habitation
for the ghost of this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just about,&rdquo; agreed Vench. &ldquo;But that little
cabin down below looks better to me, because I
bet we can get a good drink at the place. Let&rsquo;s go
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others agreed and they tramped down the
side of the slope toward a plain little cabin, constructed
of unpainted boards, with a roofed front
porch on it. At some distance below them they
could see the largest town in the county.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What town is that?&rdquo; asked Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that must be Rideway,&rdquo; replied Don.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>Reaching the cabin they rounded the corner, to
halt suddenly as they saw a figure there. It was a
little old man in a wheelchair, a man with sparse
gray hair, sallow cheeks, and a few good teeth remaining.
His eyes were keen and penetrating and
he was puffing in evident enjoyment on a huge
pipe.</p>
<p>He greeted them readily enough. &ldquo;Hi, there,
boys, step right up,&rdquo; he shrilled, in a rasping voice.
&ldquo;Soldiers, eh? You look pretty young. Where you
stationed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t soldiers of the United States Army,&rdquo;
Don told him. &ldquo;We are cadets from Woodcrest
Military Institute, and we&rsquo;re camping over on the
other side of the Ridge. We were passing by and
thought we&rsquo;d drop in for a drink of water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought you were too young-looking for regular
soldiers,&rdquo; nodded the old man, taking in every
detail of their uniforms. &ldquo;Want a drink of good
water, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Don replied. &ldquo;But we wouldn&rsquo;t want to
trouble you any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hush up!&rdquo; was the good-natured reply. &ldquo;I
know that you&rsquo;re thinking I&rsquo;m out of commission
and I can&rsquo;t help you. Just sit down on the porch
here and see how old Peter Vancouver does it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>With that the old man gave the right wheel of
his chair a whirl and to the astonishment of the
boys shot himself around in a half circle and in
through the open door. From there they saw him
roll across the room and vanish through the door
of another room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My gosh!&rdquo; breathed Terry. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t he work
that buggy of his!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably years of practice has made him proficient,&rdquo;
said Don, softly.</p>
<p>With the same bewildering speed and dexterity
the man returned in his chair, holding a pitcher
and a tin cup in his hand. Even while in motion
he poured the water out.</p>
<p>He seemed to enjoy watching the boys drink
deeply, and when they had finished he wheeled
back to the kitchen and returned at lightning
speed. Noting the interested looks of the boys he
chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess the old man knows how to walk well&rsquo;s
if he had feet, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You walk better than a whole lot of people who
have feet,&rdquo; gravely affirmed Vench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you was spending your life in one of these
all-fired things you&rsquo;d know how to ride one, too,&rdquo;
he told them. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you fellows go. I don&rsquo;t see
a heap of folks and I like to chin once in a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be glad to stay and talk with you, Mr.
Vancouver,&rdquo; smiled Jim, leaning back against a
post. &ldquo;We are just out exploring and we&rsquo;d just as
soon sit here and talk as wander around.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to hear you say it,&rdquo; approved the old man.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear something about that there camp of
yourn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys told him several things about the
camp, all of which seemed to interest him deeply.
In the course of the talk the incident of the ghost
and the stampede was mentioned. The old man
bent eagerly forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get a visit from the ghost?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he stampeded our horses,&rdquo; Jim told him.
&ldquo;What do you know about him, Mr. Vancouver?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man chuckled. &ldquo;All a poor old invalid
would know about such like he hears,&rdquo; the man
replied. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t never seen the thing, but I heard
plenty. Raises old Ned in the hills here, and has
been at it for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we get a chance we are going to nail him
good,&rdquo; Don promised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; Mr. Vancouver approved. &ldquo;Blasted
business has been driving people off the Ridge for
years. Wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the fellow drove
you cadets home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive us out of camp!&rdquo; ejaculated Vench, stirring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might!&rdquo; the old man said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have to go some to do that,&rdquo; snorted
Terry. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be lucky if we don&rsquo;t steal his best
nightgown right off him!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;Getting late, fellows,&rdquo; warned Don. &ldquo;We had
better be getting back. Thanks a lot for your good
drink of water, Mr. Vancouver, and we&rsquo;ve enjoyed
being with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enjoyed being able to talk to you boys,&rdquo; he
returned heartily. &ldquo;Come up again some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be glad to,&rdquo; promised the boys, as they
started off. Mr. Vancouver called a final word after
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better keep your eyes open for that
cussed ghost! No tellin&rsquo; when he&rsquo;ll pop up and
scare the life out of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cadets laughed good-naturedly and walked
at a rapid pace up the side of the Ridge. The sun
was going down in the west and they would have
to keep up a good stride in order to arrive in time
for supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interesting old fellow, that Vancouver,&rdquo; Jim
observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He surely is,&rdquo; Vench agreed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to
chat with him some other time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad he can&rsquo;t move around&mdash;that is, walk
around,&rdquo; Don said. &ldquo;As a matter of fact, he does
move around mighty fast, but I mean it is a shame
he can&rsquo;t go walking around, same as you and me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;Like everybody else around here, he believes
that dog-goned ghost is the last word in efficiency,&rdquo;
growled Terry. &ldquo;I guess the real trouble is that
nobody dares to put on a real hunt for the ghost.
Fellows, we&rsquo;ll have to make it our business to run
down that ghost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it pops up again soon, we will,&rdquo; Don promised.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<h2 id="c8">8
<br /><span class="small">Moving Flame</span></h2>
<p>For a week or more there were no unusual events.
Camping life went on calmly, the drill and fun occupying
the days in regular succession. By this
time all of the boys were enjoying themselves to
the utmost. Muscles were limber and strong,
bodies straight and vigorous, and the appetites
outrageous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly are keeping the cooks hustling,&rdquo;
Terry chuckled one day in the mess tent. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going for another helping of beans.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>But when the genial redhead went to the
kitchen tent he was firmly but politely refused
&ldquo;Nothing doing, Mr. Mackson,&rdquo; said the mess sergeant,
firmly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve already had three plates
full and that is the allotment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more beans for a starving man?&rdquo; Terry inquired,
in dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more for you anyway. I don&rsquo;t know why
you should be starving, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; returned the red-headed one,
calmly. &ldquo;My mother will get even with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, your mother will?&rdquo; cried
the cook, staring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When my body is shipped home, and she learns
that her darling boy starved to death in the camp,
she will spend the rest of her life calling down vengeance
upon the head of the hard-headed and
hard-hearted cook that turned him away with tears
in his eyes!&rdquo; was the answer. The mess tent shook
with the laugh that went up. But the cook was
prepared to answer him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right about the cook turning him away
with tears in his eyes,&rdquo; the cook said. &ldquo;It brings
tears to my eyes to see the hole in the bean pile
when you get eating!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry retired thoughtfully, paying no heed to
the mocking gibes which greeted him on all sides.
After a moment he looked at Vench, who was eating
across the table from him. Vench had just
pushed his plate to one side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;How many plates of beans did you have,
Raoul?&rdquo; Terry whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two was enough for me,&rdquo; returned the little
one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son, heaven&rsquo;s blessings upon you! Just take
my plate and hit the trail for the cook!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Vench took Terry&rsquo;s plate and gravely approached
the cook. But as soon as that worthy saw
the particular dent in the tin plate he shook his
head wisely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing, Mr. Vench,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That is
Mackson&rsquo;s plate. You don&rsquo;t work that game here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir!&rdquo; Vench murmured, while the
cadets enjoyed the failure of the move to the utmost.
With that Vench turned away. But at that
moment the cook was called to the far end of the
mess tent. With swiftness that was commendable
Vench reached over the stove and heaped the plate.
Then he sped back to the delighted Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ram that in your musket and keep still!&rdquo; he
said, as he took his place.</p>
<p>Terry needed no second invitation. He dug into
the pile of beans with alacrity. And in a moment
the sharp voice of the cook reached him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mackson, where did you get those beans?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>Terry looked blank. &ldquo;I am not at all sure, sir,&rdquo;
he answered, politely. &ldquo;I had just turned my back,
and when I looked around there they were, right
under my nose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you come and take them while I was not
looking?&rdquo; cried the cook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t been out of my seat since you broke
my heart with your refusal,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;And
you didn&rsquo;t give any to Mr. Vench, so it is up to
you to figure out how I got the beans!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring them here, Mr. Mackson!&rdquo; ordered the
mess sergeant.</p>
<p>Terry shoveled the last forkful into his mouth.
&ldquo;Beg pardon?&rdquo; he asked blandly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put you on report!&rdquo; growled the sergeant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; smiled Terry. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t take them myself and so you have no charge
to prefer. And if you did I&rsquo;d pound all the beans
out of you once I got you away from the mess
tent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That amounts to threatening an officer while
on duty, Mr. Mackson!&rdquo; charged the sergeant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a threat, that&rsquo;s a promise,&rdquo; grinned
the redhead. The sergeant muttered savagely but
subsided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much obliged,&rdquo; Terry whispered to Vench.
&ldquo;Some day I&rsquo;ll help you out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not in the matter of beans,&rdquo; smiled Vench.
&ldquo;They just don&rsquo;t happen to be my weakness!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>One of the steady visitors to the camp was the
little Carson boy. He was the son of the farmer
from whom the camp supplies were purchased,
and the cadets had taken a great liking to him.
He was a friendly, likable boy and obviously
deeply interested in the activities of the young soldiers.
He watched all of their maneuvers with
fascinated interest and the cadets welcomed him
in their tents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That youngster has the makings of a good
cadet in him,&rdquo; Don said. &ldquo;Too bad he isn&rsquo;t one
of us. How would you like to be a cadet,
Jimmie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy flushed with pleasure and looked
around the tent. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like it more than anything
else in the world,&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you a
secret. Want to hear it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if it isn&rsquo;t too deep for us, we would,&rdquo;
Jim assured him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m saving my money to go to Woodcrest,&rdquo; the
little fellow confided. &ldquo;Guess how much I have
saved already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine, but I hope it is a lot,&rdquo; replied
Don.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is!&rdquo; was the eager retort. &ldquo;I have a dollar and
fifty-seven cents toward it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; said Terry promptly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
need a little more than that, but it is a good beginning,
anyway. Just you keep on going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll surely be glad when I get a uniform like
you have,&rdquo; the boy went on, wistfully. &ldquo;I think
they&rsquo;re swell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were other boys who drifted to the camp
but they did not attract the attention of the cadets
as much as the Carson boy did. They came to look
around and fool a bit and in time most of them
were chased away. But Jimmie Carson was never
in the way and so he was allowed to come often to
camp.</p>
<p>One afternoon a group of cadets went for another
hike over the Ridge and on the way back
they passed the Carson farm. Jimmie called to
them to come in and they did so. To their delight
Mrs. Carson, a plain, kindly woman of middle
age, insisted that they try a huge apple pie that
she had made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give any to Terry, Mrs. Carson,&rdquo; begged
Jim, as they sat on the back porch. Don, Jim,
Terry, Douglas and Vench were there at the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is that? Doesn&rsquo;t he feel well?&rdquo; the farmer&rsquo;s
wife inquired, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has had stomach trouble for a long time,&rdquo;
returned Jim, gravely. &ldquo;The doctor said that of
all things in the world, he mustn&rsquo;t eat apple pie!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is, Mrs. Carson,&rdquo; spoke up
the persecuted one, before anything else could be
said. &ldquo;I have a falling stomach and I can&rsquo;t seem to
locate the bottom at any time. But I&rsquo;m sure that if
I can only have a slice of that apple pie I&rsquo;ll surely
plug up the floor of my stomach and have no more
trouble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the left-handed compliments in the
world!&rdquo; gasped Douglas. &ldquo;He must think your pie
is some kind of cement with which to secure his
stomach. Tell a lady that her pie will plug him
up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Carson laughed heartily. &ldquo;I guess there is
nothing the matter with any of you boys,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Try my pie and see if it is like cement!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could die of embarrassment!&rdquo; murmured
Terry, as he bit into his piece of pie. &ldquo;But this pie
will surely revive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The farmer himself came up and talked to the
boys for a time. The unexpected arrival of the soldiers
on the Ridge and the subsequent contract to
supply them with fresh food had done wonders for
the poor farmer and his family. A good many dollars
were coming his way from the camp down the
slope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the baby of the family,&rdquo; smiled Mrs.
Carson, appearing a little later with a pretty little
girl of six. The cadets promptly forgot all else in
their efforts to amuse and entertain Dorothy Carson.
It was late before they headed back to camp,
after thanking the farmer&rsquo;s wife for the good time
they had had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had pie before,&rdquo; murmured Terry. &ldquo;But
never such pie as that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; inquired Jim. &ldquo;Well, it is a cinch
that Don and I can&rsquo;t believe anything you say
hereafter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because one time at our house you said the
same thing about my mother&rsquo;s pie,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t forget, this pie helped his stomach!&rdquo;
said Vench, slyly. &ldquo;Probably your mother&rsquo;s pie
didn&rsquo;t plug up the bottom of his stomach!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I ever speak again, it will be to myself, and
in a dark room,&rdquo; sighed Terry.</p>
<p>They had not been back in the tent long before
the Officer of the Guard appeared at the tent with
a list in his hand. &ldquo;Lieutenant Mercer, you will report
for guard duty at Post Number Three at
twelve o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he informed Don.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; Don saluted.</p>
<p>At midnight Lieutenant Don reported to the
sentry at the far end of the camp, at a point near
the farm belonging to the Hyde family. After an
exchange of instructions he took the post, waiting
for the call. It came soon after.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sentry, Post Two,&rdquo; someone said near to him.
Don faced toward the sentry who was next to him.
&ldquo;Sentry, Post Three,&rdquo; he called. Number Four
passed the report call on until eight sentries had
reported. Then they began their pacing up and
down on their patrols.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;s stretch was a long one, extending from
the edge of the camp at the company street to a
point back of the horse corral. At no time did he
meet the sentry who patrolled Post Four. Just at
the time Don reached the place where Post Four
joined his post the other sentry was at the far end
of his stretch, and when Don had returned to the
company street Number Four was at the beginning
of his post patrol. In this way there was no
likelihood of sentries stopping to chat and no huge
gaps left in the line of patrol duty.</p>
<p>The moon was a mere slice but the stars were
bright pinheads in the sky. The air was warm and
heavy with the smell of the woods. Don enjoyed
his patrol thoroughly. At twelve-thirty he looked
up the Ridge casually. Toward the top he saw a
tiny jet of flame, right above the Hyde place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like somebody striking a match,&rdquo; he reflected,
pacing slowly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Then he stopped quickly. The jet of flame
sprang up rapidly. Something was burning, flaring
up into a huge ball of roaring fire. And as Don
looked, completely at a loss, this mass of flame
moved with ever increasing speed down the hill
toward the Hyde house!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<h2 id="c9">9
<br /><span class="small">Sharp Work as Fire Fighters</span></h2>
<p>Don stood spellbound while the huge ball of fire
rolled down on the Hyde place. There was a crash
that he could hear plainly even at his distance and
the burning ball hit the barn. In a twinkling of an
eye the wooden structure caught fire.</p>
<p>Then Don came to life. Raising his rifle he fired
three swift shots, waking the camp instantly.</p>
<p>The Officer of the Guard rushed up to him.
&ldquo;What is the trouble, Lieutenant?&rdquo; the cadet
panted. But a red glow in the sky told him the
story at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Report a large fire at that farmhouse,&rdquo; said
Don. The Officer of the Guard dug for the colonel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>By this time the cadet camp was well lighted by
the glare from Hyde&rsquo;s barn. The colonel saw that
hard work was needed and he directed the bugler
to sound assembly. This was done, and the half-dressed
cadets fell in formation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Secure all pails and double-quick it to the
farmhouse!&rdquo; was the order. The colonel knew that
in this rural area there was no organized fire department
and whatever attempts were made to
extinguish a fire always came from helpful neighbors.
Instantly, the ranks broke and the commissary
department was fairly turned upside down as
the soldiers rummaged for pails. When these had
been secured they raced down the company street
and took the road to Hyde&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Fortunately for them&mdash;and for the Hydes&mdash;the
distance was short. When the first cadets arrived in
the front yard the barn was a roaring furnace.
Hyde and his two sons were running around the
yard in an aimless fashion and as Jim and Terry
arrived the three of them dashed into the blazing
barn. A moment later they came out, each of them
hanging onto squealing, thrashing horses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;The horses!&rdquo; cried Jim, and at the word the
cavalrymen and the artillerymen formed a body
around him. In a mass they rushed the door of the
barn. Fighting their way inside past the Hydes,
who were coming out, the cadets paused to look
about the stable, gasping as the heavy smoke
crowded down their lungs.</p>
<p>The inside of the barn was curiously lighted. A
pall of heavy smoke hung in the structure, and
through this curtain the dull red flames shone and
licked. Snapping and crackling sounds reached
their ears as the wood burned, and a terrible
shrieking, from the terrified horses, went right
through them. Blind with fear the animals kicked
and screamed.</p>
<p>No word was spoken as the cadets made a rush
for the nearest horses. Jim had not put on a shirt,
but some of the others had and these they now
whipped off, throwing them over the heads of the
rearing animals. Jim scooped a blanket up from
the rack as he passed and made a cast for the head
of a big dray horse in a stall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>But now his troubles began. The horse, wild
with fright, avoided the blanket. It kicked at Jim
and even snapped, tearing frantically on its halter.
The heat was cracking Jim&rsquo;s skin, the smoke
choked him, and the crazy horse made his head
ache trying to follow his rapid movements. Worse
than that, the halter was tied in a ring on the wall,
and the cavalryman was unable to pull it loose.
As he was ready to sob with anger his fingers closed
over the catch and with a jerk that tore his skin
he loosed the rearing horse. Like a flash the
animal backed from its stall and tried to find the
door.</p>
<p>Now Jim succeeded in getting the blanket over
his head and he felt his way to the door. The first
breath of fresh air that he got went through him
like the stab of a sword. Stumbling at every step
he led the trembling horse to a tree far away from
the barn and tied him securely. The smell of burning
hair jabbed his nose and he knew that the
animal had been burned in more than one place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go back,&rdquo; he gasped, gulping the air
in huge draughts. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t, I just can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he started back, his feet like lead and his
head ready to burst. Before he reached the door of
the barn, however, a blackened figure with red
hair stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all out,&rdquo; Terry shouted. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m all
in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together they sank down on the rude back steps
of the farmhouse, entirely played out. While they
sat there the bucket brigade was in full swing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Those cadets who had been fortunate enough to
secure buckets had jumped into action without
wasting a moment&rsquo;s time. The vanguard found
the well and began to pump vigorously. As soon
as the first pail was filled it was passed from hand
to hand and the last cadet, running as close to the
fire as the heat would allow him to, tossed it on
the blaze. By the time he had finished a second
cadet had run forward with another pail full. A
second contingent of cadets, impatient at waiting
around the well, found a small creek back of the
barn and the buckets were dipped in here. Two
steady streams were now being played in splashes
on the blaze.</p>
<p>There was no hope of saving the barn but the
work went grimly forward. A mountain of sparks
was ascending, threatening the house and the
smaller structures near by, to say nothing of the
fields and woods. It required a special corps to put
out scores of small fires that jumped up in the
fields and on the other buildings. But in time the
splashing buckets of water kept the sparks down
and although the barn burned to the ground the
house and smaller buildings were saved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>It seemed to the cadets that they had been working
for hours on their task. Numerous neighbors
had run over from near-by farms, armed with
buckets and blankets, and their assistance was a
welcome help. A wheezing old hand-pump on a
flat truck was finally run into the yard and the
water from the creek was thrown in a more or less
uncertain stream on the smoldering embers of the
ruins, but had the Hydes been compelled to wait
for it and for the neighbors they would have been
burned out of the house and home. Clouds of hissing
steam rose from the blackened wood as the
water was pumped and thrown on it.</p>
<p>Jim and Terry had braced up sufficiently to join
the bucket brigade and they passed the pails with
the others. Some of the cadets had stormed in the
back door of Hyde&rsquo;s house and had located a few
pails and pans. As for the father and his two sons
they had not been of much use after the horses had
been taken. Utterly bewildered by the swift events
they had run from place to place, too shaken to do
anything practical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were all of the animals taken out?&rdquo; the colonel
asked the farmer. He nodded dully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t nothing but horses in that barn,&rdquo; he
returned. &ldquo;The chickens is in the run there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The unfortunate chickens were scorched by the
heat which had been so near to them but all of
them were alive. They had run around the long
inclosure squawking and screeching but the damage
had not touched them. Some pigs near by were
safe enough, and the only thing which had suffered
was the barn itself and the horses, most of
whom were burned in patches. Jim, who had recovered
from his experience, dispatched a man to
the camp to bring soothing salve for the animals&rsquo;
burns. This was done and under Jim and Thompson&rsquo;s
watchful eyes the scorches were tenderly
glossed over to heal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>A large group had gathered around the farmer
and his sons and the cadets. One of the neighbors
asked how the fire had started. Hyde shrugged his
shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;All of a sudden I waked
up to see the fire and we run out in a jiffy. I didn&rsquo;t
see how it got afire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colonel turned to Don, who was close by.
&ldquo;How did you happen to see this fire, Lieutenant
Mercer?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Don narrated the story of the moving flame. The
neighbors shot inquiring looks at the Hydes. A
dozen tongues formed the word &ldquo;Maul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maul is dead,&rdquo; said one of the sons. &ldquo;How
could he do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget the ghost of the Ridge,&rdquo; said a
man, seriously. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Maul&rsquo;s ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The oldest son had been prowling about the
ruins and now set up a cry. &ldquo;Look-a-here, Pop,&rdquo;
he called. There was an instant rush to the rear
of the barn.</p>
<p>In the dim light of a few lanterns they made out
the charred outline of wheels and under a smoking
board some whisps of straw. A murmur of comprehension
went up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;Loaded a wagon of hay and lighted her up,&rdquo;
shouted a farmer. &ldquo;Then they rolled it down the
hill at the barn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no doubt that such had been the case.
And no one seemed to ask why, a fact that puzzled
the colonel and the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should anyone do a thing like that? And
who is this Maul?&rdquo; the colonel asked.</p>
<p>None of the Hydes replied but a neighbor was
willing to talk. &ldquo;A few years back there was a hill
feud between the Hydes and the Mauls,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;One or the other of them was trying to drive the
other family out. But all of the Mauls disappeared
or died several years ago. This here ghost must be
one of the Mauls!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidently a very real Maul, if he can load a
wagon with hay and roll it down the hill,&rdquo; replied
the colonel dryly. &ldquo;Captain Jordan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo; the senior captain replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a detail of men and search the hill. If
you find anyone that looks suspicious bring him
here to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; replied Jordan, and picked a
detail of five men. They departed up the slope at
once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t find any ghost hanging around
now,&rdquo; grinned a toothless old man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>The colonel paid no attention to the old man
and they hung around for an hour longer. It was
now three o&rsquo;clock, but no one thought of quitting
the scene. From snatches of conversation the cadets
learned more about the bitter feud that had existed
for generations between the Hydes and the
Mauls. The last Maul had been drowned in a
near-by river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least he was swept down the river in a
flood,&rdquo; a neighbor said. &ldquo;Nobody ever saw him
since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, these foolish feuds ought to stop,&rdquo;
growled the colonel. &ldquo;A lot of innocent people
suffer because of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll attend to our own affairs,&rdquo; the father
said, sullenly. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need any interfering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for our interfering tonight
you would have been without a dozen horses and
your house, my friend,&rdquo; returned the colonel,
calmly. The Hydes muttered to themselves.</p>
<p>Jordan and the detail returned soon afterward
to report that there was no sign of anyone on the
hill. &ldquo;But we found the tracks and a lot of hay up
on top of the hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was now nothing to keep them there any
longer and they went back to camp, tired but satisfied.
There was no word of thanks from the
farmer or his sons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nice, grateful bunch,&rdquo; grumbled Don, inspecting
sore hands and a red burn on his arm.</p>
<p>Jim ached all over but he managed to grin.
&ldquo;Sure, but we should worry. We got the horses
out, and that is what counted.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<h2 id="c10">10
<br /><span class="small">Emergency Service</span></h2>
<p>The drill was going on merrily. It was four days
after the fire at the Hyde place and the cadets had
recovered from the effects of their strenuous experience.
On the day following the fire the colonel
had ordered the suspension of the daily routine
and a number of burns had been treated. Weary
muscles and sore lungs had been rested to good
advantage and now the swing of things was once
more in evidence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>All of the units were having infantry drill. Even
the cavalry and infantry divisions were compelled
to drill with rifles every so often, and today, under
Major Rhodes, a graduate of the school and one
of the regular staff, they were hard at it. The sun
beat down upon them from a clear sky but by this
time the cadets were well used to it. The hottest
days failed to shake them in their tasks.</p>
<p>Suddenly the colonel appeared and called the
major. There was a hurried conference and then
the major went back to his position. Crisply he
called: &ldquo;Battalion, attention! Count off in fours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The count ran along the line. At a further word
the guns were dropped to rest and the cadets faced
the colonel. He spoke to them in a ringing voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen of the Corps, we are faced with another
call to duty. A good many serious things
have happened while we have been here on the
Ridge, but this is the most serious of them all.
The little daughter of the farmer who supplies us
with food has been lost or kidnapped!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The closely packed ranks stirred. The colonel
went on: &ldquo;A number of organized groups are at
present looking for this child all over the Ridge.
We have not been asked to help, but of course it is
our duty and we will form searching parties at
once. There will be no more official duties until
the child has been found or until some definite
word has been received as to her whereabouts. I
trust you will dutifully prosecute the search until
every inch of the Ridge and the surrounding country
has been scoured.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>The colonel saluted the major and turned away.</p>
<p>There was a total silence in the corps but eyes
flashed with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Companies dismissed,&rdquo; ordered Major Rhodes.</p>
<p>The cadets broke ranks and stacked arms. From
then on things moved fast. In groups the young
soldiers formed for the search. It was decided that
they would remain away from camp for the night
if necessary, and knapsacks were hastily packed.
While Don, Jim and Terry were preparing, Vench
and Douglas hurried to their tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we five form a bunch of our own,&rdquo;
Douglas suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; responded Don. &ldquo;I think our best move
would be to go to the Carson house and find out
where the little girl was last seen. Then we can
map out our campaign from that point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was agreed to and the cadets hurried off
down the road. It was just noontime and they
wanted to get in every bit of work they could while
the daylight remained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the cute little girl we were playing
with the day we had the pie,&rdquo; observed Vench, as
they hurried along. &ldquo;I certainly hope nothing has
happened to her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; agreed Don. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible that she
just wandered off somewhere. Wonder who told
the colonel about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Jimmie Carson,&rdquo; said Jim promptly. &ldquo;I
saw him come into camp just as we were leaving
for drill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It did not take them long to reach the Carson
house, which they found to be thronged with visitors.
Men from the neighboring houses had come
to do their bit by searching and the strong Ridge
women had come to console the heartbroken
mother. Mrs. Carson was delighted to see the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you have come to help look for Dorothy?&rdquo;
she cried, seizing Don&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our colonel has ordered the whole cadet corps
to keep searching until we find the little one,&rdquo; Don
smiled. &ldquo;We have divided up in bands to scour
the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How very kind of your colonel&mdash;and of you!&rdquo;
cried the frightened woman. &ldquo;With so many looking
for the child I don&rsquo;t see why she shouldn&rsquo;t be
found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless she&rsquo;s past finding!&rdquo; croaked an old lady
with a sad air and mournful eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t past finding,&rdquo; snapped Jim, impatiently.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any doubt that we&rsquo;ll locate her.
Now, Mrs. Carson, where was she last seen?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;She went out last night about nine o&rsquo;clock to
bring in a rag doll that she had left out under the
grape arbor,&rdquo; replied the farmer&rsquo;s wife. &ldquo;I held
the door open for her, so that she would surely
find her way in, but she didn&rsquo;t, poor little soul.
Oh, I&rsquo;m so sorry that I ever let her go out. We
searched the yard immediately, but we couldn&rsquo;t
find a trace of her, and she didn&rsquo;t answer our
calls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Don gently. &ldquo;Then she disappeared
from her own back yard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; nodded Mrs. Carson, wiping her eyes.</p>
<p>At that moment the county sheriff, a tall and
disagreeable-looking man named Blount, swaggered
into the room. It was evident that he regarded
himself as the most important person there
and as his eyes fell on the cadets his brow darkened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;So those soldier kids
are looking too, eh? Well, they won&rsquo;t find anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry looked at the sheriff&rsquo;s shoes, and then allowed
his eyes to travel slowly up the entire length
of his body until he had seen all of him. The
sheriff reddened and then blustered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; returned Terry, mildly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never
really seen an important man before and I wanted
to get a good look now that I am close to one!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;ll run you kids&mdash;&rdquo; began the angry sheriff,
as a slight snicker went up. But Don cut him
short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, you fellows,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;We have
work to do. No use standing around wasting breath
on useless subjects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice kindly old soul, that sheriff,&rdquo; growled
Vench, when the cadets were again outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t worth thinking about,&rdquo; said Don.
&ldquo;Now, boys, let&rsquo;s get on the job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their first job was to look under the grape
arbor, but scores of feet had churned up the
ground so that nothing could be learned from it.
They left the yard and struck off into the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad we couldn&rsquo;t find a clue under the
arbor,&rdquo; grumbled Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if there were any clues,&rdquo; advanced Jim.
&ldquo;Some of the men would have seen them in the
first place. After all, we aren&rsquo;t detectives, and our
job is to beat up the Ridge much in the manner
of going over it with a fine-tooth comb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; nodded Vench. &ldquo;Suppose we
don&rsquo;t run across her tonight? Are you going back
to camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; decided Don. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d only lose time. We&rsquo;ll
stay here and get a fresh start early in the morning.
The colonel wants us to stay right on the job
until some trace of her is found.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;How are we to know if she is found?&rdquo; Douglas
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cannon will be fired three times,&rdquo; replied
Terry. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the signal for recall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throughout the entire afternoon and early evening
the cadets tramped over the Ridge, going to
parts of the rolling hills that they had never seen
before. There was no sign of the little one, although
they kept their eyes wide open, and it was
quite late before they struck camp for the night.
They made a fire and spread out their blankets
and provisions.</p>
<p>While they ate darkness descended over the
Ridge. The meal was a good one and the tired
cadets ate heartily. Afterward they discussed the
wisdom of keeping watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that anyone will come along and gobble
us up,&rdquo; said Terry, &ldquo;but if that child should call
out in the night we&rsquo;d miss her if we were all
asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Jim said. &ldquo;And, anyway, I think
we ought to have a fire going all night. We&rsquo;ll want
one in the morning. That ghost is some human
being bent on mischief and we must keep our eyes
open for him. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s mixed up in this thing,
somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>This was agreed to and the boys figured out
watches for themselves. During the evening, before
they went to sleep, they sat around on their
blankets and talked quietly, listening for any call
or unusual sound. None came and at nine o&rsquo;clock
they decided to turn in.</p>
<p>Throughout the night the separate watches
were faithfully kept and the cadet who sat watch
listened to the night sounds. But when the morning
finally came and they rolled out at daybreak,
not one of them had heard a single sound that
would lead them to hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to put in a good hard day,&rdquo; Don
said, as they ate the last of their sandwiches.</p>
<p>Terry scrambled to his feet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going down
to the brook and fill my canteen,&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where there is a spring around and
that brook looks perfectly all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you had better boil the water and make
sure before you drink it,&rdquo; Vench suggested.</p>
<p>Terry went back into the bushes some fifty feet
until he found a gurgling little brook. The water
looked cool and refreshing as it bubbled around
the stones, and the redhead bent down to fill his
canteen. It was then that a sound reached him, a
sound that caused him to straighten up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, did the brook make that sound?&rdquo; he
wondered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>But it came again and Terry hesitated no longer.
With a single bound he hopped across the water
and parted the bushes on the other side. There, in
a tiny hollow like a cave, her feet wet and her
clothing covered with mud, sat the little Carson
girl, her eyes red with weeping and her face
swollen from her contact with vines and branches.
She stared in wild terror at Terry as he broke his
way through the bushes, but as he spoke to her the
look faded for one of glad recognition.</p>
<p>A trembling gladness filled the boy. With a
smothered cry he jumped at the child, sweeping
her in his arms and pressing her to him as though
she had been his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You blessed little mischief-maker!&rdquo; he choked.
&ldquo;What are you doing out here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ghost, he chase me,&rdquo; wailed the child, beginning
to tremble. &ldquo;I go for my dolly and the
ghost come after me. I want my mama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to have your mama,&rdquo; promised
Terry. &ldquo;So that confounded ghost is at the bottom
of it, is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he chase me,&rdquo; sighed the child. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
the soldier that ate mama&rsquo;s pie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; grinned Terry. &ldquo;Come along,
I&rsquo;m going to take you home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gathered the little body in his arms, easily
jumped the creek, and fairly flew back to the camp.
The others were rolling up their bundles as he
dashed up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;Took you a long time to get that water,&rdquo; Jim
hailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you what kind of water I got,&rdquo;
whooped the happy redhead. &ldquo;Allow me to introduce
Miss Dorothy Carson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A medley of cries greeted the good news and the
child and Terry were nearly knocked over in the
rush. Dorothy Carson was pawed by the boys but
did not seem to mind it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you find her?&rdquo; Don asked, squeezing
Terry&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heard her crying back of some bushes,&rdquo; was
the reply. &ldquo;That darned old ghost chased her away
from the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The return journey was swiftly made to Carson&rsquo;s
house and the mother was nearly frantic with
joy. At the farmhouse they found the colonel with
Major Rhodes, and together they all listened to
the story of the child regarding the ghost. She had
gone out to get the doll, had seen the fearful shape
near the chicken house, and too terrified to call
out she had run away into the hills, where she had
wandered until Terry had found her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>The boys were overwhelmed with thanks and
praises and Terry&rsquo;s face became as red as his hair.
The boastful sheriff was away at the time with a
posse and there was no one to resent their success.
After a happy time at the house they all went back
to camp. Terry had the honor of firing the &ldquo;Gossip&rdquo;
three times as the recall. Before two o&rsquo;clock
the entire corps was back in camp, eagerly exchanging
news. All of them had searched faithfully.</p>
<p>Just before taps that night Jordan, Terry, Don,
Jim, Douglas and Vench were requested to report
to the colonel after drill on the following day.
Wondering what could be in the wind the cadets
went to bed, to sleep soundly after their strenuous
search.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<h2 id="c11">11
<br /><span class="small">The Ghost Patrol</span></h2>
<p>On the following day, when the General Orders
were read, the cadets who had been most active in
the search for Dorothy were warmly commended.
All of the cadets were thanked by the colonel.
Then the officers called for three rousing cheers
for Cadet Mackson. These were given with a will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mackson again!&rdquo; hissed Cadet Rowen, under
his breath. &ldquo;It was only an accident and yet he gets
a cheer for it. Wouldn&rsquo;t that make you sick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one being addressed, no answer was given.
But Terry himself felt that it was simply an accident.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;I just happened to be there at the brook at the
right moment and heard her crying,&rdquo; he told his
friends. &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t been the one, someone else
would have run across her eventually. So I don&rsquo;t
see what the fuss is all about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We make a fuss because you are such an old
souse!&rdquo; laughed Jim. &ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t gone for a
drink it might have been days before the child was
found. Lucky thing you like to drink so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drink nothing but water all my life, in
honor of the piece of service that drink did me,&rdquo;
promised the redhead.</p>
<p>In the mess tent that noontime the colonel
rapped on the head table for order. The rattling
of spoons and plates became still and the cadets
faced him expectantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said the colonel. &ldquo;Since we have
been here on the Ridge we have been quite deeply
annoyed by this silly ghost that has been playing
tricks in the neighborhood. I say silly in the sense
that it is silly to play at such small things, but in
another sense it may turn out to be something serious.
I think that we have all had enough of the
business and I promise you that if that ghost comes
around the camp we will make short work of him.
Now, what I want you to do is this: if you, any of
you, learn anything definite about this ghost,
either from hearsay or your own observations, I
want all facts reported to me at once. Although we
haven&rsquo;t time to go meddling all over the Ridge I
think we are duty-bound to lay this ghost if possible,
and so let me know whatever you learn about
this ghost business.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>There was a buzz as the headmaster sat down
and the ghost of the Ridge furnished the topic for
discussion during the rest of the meal. Drill ended
that, and after the afternoon work was over the
cadets named on the previous evening reported at
the colonel&rsquo;s big tent. He was waiting for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down anywhere you can, boys,&rdquo; he told
them. &ldquo;On the bed or the chairs. I guess we can
find room for all of us. Will you pull the flap
closed, Captain Jordan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jordan obeyed and the colonel faced his interested
boys. &ldquo;Well, you heard what I had to say today
at the mess tent regarding the responsibility
of each cadet in regard to the ghost trouble on this
Ridge. That will do very nicely for the corps at
large, for if I gave some of them too much authority
some grave mistakes of overzealousness would
probably follow. But to you young men I want to
give a commission that I&rsquo;m sure you will handle
with care and tact.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>He paused and nothing was said. Crossing his
knees the colonel went on: &ldquo;I spoke of the fact
that ruining this ghost and his game was our duty
as citizens, and it is. Inquiry has revealed that the
people hereabouts are very superstitious, and they
have taken this ghost on trust for several years. Of
course, in a community of sensible men and
women the thing would have been run out long
ago, but there is just enough fear and superstition
in the people around here to imagine this ghost
to be the real thing and not some human being
who is simply playing on their fears and ignorance.
You may have noticed that when we brought that
child back to Mrs. Carson she simply said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
never let you out again where that ghost can scare
you.&rsquo; No question or thought about driving him
away, but just a passive resignation to the fact that
he is here and belongs here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this ghost does not belong here, boys, and
we must see to it that he does not stay here. At
school we teach you that every man has a duty to
the public, and even here, in a strange country,
we have our challenge. We must track down this
ghost and expose him. We have the right to do so
because he has invaded our camp and stampeded
our horses. But I want the whole thing done
quietly and steady heads must take up the task.
I have therefore picked you young men to tackle
this problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll enjoy it, sir!&rdquo; smiled Jordan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;What I want you to do is this,&rdquo; nodded the
colonel. &ldquo;I want you six cadets to form yourself
into a secret Ghost Patrol. You are to keep it
strictly to yourselves, and you are to make every
effort to get some trace of this ghost. I give you
full liberty to leave camp at any hour, and every
hour, to pass sentries whenever it is really necessary,
and to cut drill if the necessity should arise.
I am not going to tell you how you should go about
it, because I really don&rsquo;t know myself, but I will
leave the working out of plans to you. Obviously,
it will be out of the question to simply rove over
the Ridge in a band, for that would soon advertise
itself, but I&rsquo;m sure you will make a plan that
will bring results. If at any time there is a call
that the ghost has been sighted around the camp
you will dash out and make a thorough search for
him. I guess that is all clear, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, sir,&rdquo; replied Jordan. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do the
best that we can for the community in this case.
I have heard that in the last few years a number
of good, honest families have left the Ridge simply
because of this silly situation, and a thing like that
has no business to be.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, it has no business to be,&rdquo; retorted
the colonel. &ldquo;Not when an individual rolls a blazing
hay wagon downhill and burns up a man&rsquo;s
barn, and then scares a child away from her home.
To say nothing of stampeding our horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of that theory regarding the
Maul and Hyde feud, colonel?&rdquo; Don asked, from
his seat on the cot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think there may be something in it,&rdquo; was the
answer. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find out what the feud was all
about, and probably the present families don&rsquo;t
know, so stupid are such things. It is much like
those you hear about in the Kentucky mountains,
where families kill each other off for generations
over causes that never touched them personally.
But I gather that the last of the Mauls was supposed
to have been drowned and his body was
never found. That points to only one thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think that he is alive and doing all this
ghost business?&rdquo; Jim asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised. As far as I can learn
no one but the Hydes have ever been actively molested.
Numbers of persons have been scared by
the sight of the white shape, but only the Hydes
have been harmed. If it had not been for the heroic
work done by you cadets the other night Hyde
would have been burned completely out of house
and home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now that every sentry has been told to
promptly report any trace of the ghost we may
have an even chance of nailing him,&rdquo; Douglas observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, though you may have to work fast. Well,
that will be all. You will kindly keep that to yourselves
and consider yourselves as a special Ghost
Patrol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they had left the colonel the cadets separated
and went to their tents. While preparing for
the evening meal they talked things over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you notice, the colonel spoke about the
ghost starting the stampede,&rdquo; Jim said, as he
washed vigorously. &ldquo;That shows that he believes
my story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess there is no doubt of that,&rdquo; responded
Don. &ldquo;He simply can&rsquo;t doubt Rowen&rsquo;s word on
the face of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the evening meal was ready it began to
rain. The cadets had been fortunate in the weather
during their stay in camp, and up to the present
time only showers had occurred occasionally. But
tonight the rain meant business, for it settled in
for a long spell. Before long the company streets
were a mass of mud. It was necessary to make a
dash for the mess tent, and all the time they ate
the steady pouring of the rain could be heard on
the canvas overhead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>There were no campfires that night and the
cadets clustered in their own tents. The sentries
looked forward to a bleak and joyless patrol, but
the colonel knew that a sample of army life under
all conditions was good for the young soldiers. As
long as they were well-shod and amply protected
from the rain there was no danger of sickness, and
a taste of duty under stern circumstances was beneficial
rather than harmful to the cadets.</p>
<p>Jordan, Vench and Douglas slopped their way
over to the tent occupied by the three friends. This
tent was the end one on the rear company street,
backed up against the woods. The tent light
made the place seem homelike, and it was warm
inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine night, if anyone likes it,&rdquo; grinned Vench,
as he took off his wet raincoat. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t have
anything else to do so we came over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to have you,&rdquo; smiled Don. &ldquo;It looks like
a particularly dull evening. I&rsquo;ll bet we&rsquo;ll harp on
the one subject, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the glories of the Ghost Patrol, eh?&rdquo;
laughed Jordan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you guess?&rdquo; Don retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is something new,&rdquo; Douglas said. &ldquo;Early
in the year the Mercers, Terry and I were on the
beach patrol, but this is the first time I ever heard
of a Ghost Patrol.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;All I hope is that we get some results out of
this new organization,&rdquo; Terry said.</p>
<p>They talked of the task ahead of them for some
time. Suddenly Jim held up his hand, signaling
for silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you fellows hear anything?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>No one had. &ldquo;What was it like?&rdquo; Jordan asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I heard someone close to the back
of the tent,&rdquo; said Jim, slipping on his raincoat.
&ldquo;Wait&rsquo;ll I take a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who would sneak around a tent on a night like
this?&rdquo; scoffed Vench, as Jim slipped out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t see anything,&rdquo; Jim said, returning and
shaking the rain off his coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hope you don&rsquo;t hear anything else tonight,&rdquo;
grumbled Terry. &ldquo;Might as well bring a
dog in here to shake himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long before taps the visitors had gone and the
friends turned in. In the morning the rain had
stopped, but a gray sky hung over the camp. Just
as assembly was breaking up the Officer on Inspection
reported to the colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something to show you on a tree at the end of
the camp, sir,&rdquo; he reported.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>The cadets swarmed around the colonel as he
took a heavy piece of cardboard from a tree not
far from the tent occupied by the Mercers and
Terry. In large, crude letters this warning was
written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="small">YOU DURNED TIN SOLDIERS KEEP YOURE
NOSE OUTN THE GHOST BUSINESS.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<h2 id="c12">12
<br /><span class="small">A Brush with the Sheriff</span></h2>
<p>The cardboard had been propped up in the space
provided by a small branch. The letters had been
wet and faint streaks showed where they had run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sentries who were on duty last night
please step forward,&rdquo; requested the colonel. A
number of cadets promptly stepped forward, facing
the colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did any one of you at any time during the
night see or hear anyone around the camp?&rdquo; Not
one sentry had noted anything amiss.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you of an experience that happened
to us last night, colonel,&rdquo; spoke up Jim. &ldquo;We were
discussing the whole ghost situation on the Ridge,
and our determination to find out who this ghost
was, when we heard a noise outside our tent. I
might more accurately say that I heard it, and I
went outside to see if anyone was there. I didn&rsquo;t
find anyone, but it looks as though someone did
sneak up to our tent, hear what we had to say,
and then printed this sign to scare us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in order to do so the party must have gone
back to some shelter and spent some time making
up the warning, if such it might be called,&rdquo; mused
the headmaster. &ldquo;I have no doubt, however, that
your conversation was overheard. This ghost has
developed a bad habit of visiting our camp whenever
he feels like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t have been hard to slip past a sentry
in the pouring rain, sir,&rdquo; suggested Jordan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not at all,&rdquo; agreed the colonel. &ldquo;With this
reference to your soldiering, I presume that you
young men will have an added cause now to go
after this ghost person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty heavy insult!&rdquo; smiled Major
Rhodes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the ghost must know now that an active
campaign is afoot to drive him off the Ridge,&rdquo; said
the colonel. &ldquo;That ought to make the game more
interesting than ever. Our foe is warned and will
play his game with skill. That gives you boys
greater odds to move against, but I feel sure that
you will be successful in making an end to the
affair.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>The regular routine of that day seemed to take
longer than usual, but as soon as it was over the
members of the Ghost Patrol gathered together to
look around in back of the camp for signs of the
night visitor. The ground was wet and they argued
that if the prowler ever left any traces he
would surely have done so that night. Their first
search took in the soft soil back of Jim&rsquo;s tent and
they found encouraging signs at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than one footprint here,&rdquo; proclaimed
Don, grimly, as they bent over the depressions in
the dirt.</p>
<p>Someone had sneaked up close to the wall of the
tent, and the prints of large shoes were very plain.
In the heels of the left shoe they found a peculiarity
that gave them something to work on. There
had been some kind of a cut down the center of
the leather heel and it showed plainly in the soft
mud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe when the heel was cut out of block
leather the knife slipped and left that mark,&rdquo; Jordan
thought. &ldquo;With a plain marking like that we
ought not to have much trouble. Let&rsquo;s look under
that tree where the cardboard was found.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>Under this tree they had more difficulty, because
the feet of the curious cadets had churned up the
ground so that it was almost impossible to make
out anything definite. But at a distance of perhaps
three yards they found the marked heel print
again. Whoever had placed the sign in the tree
had come down the slope above the camp, and the
print could be followed for a short distance up
the hillside. But before long they struck a section
of rocky ground and hunt as they would they
could not find another trace of the print.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A whole lot of this Ridge is pretty rocky,&rdquo;
sighed Douglas. &ldquo;From here on I guess we&rsquo;ll have
to trust to luck. Somewhere we may run across
the trail again and get our bearings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They explored the slope with exhausting patience,
but there was no further trace until they
struck the very top of the hill. There, in a soft
spot, they once more found their marking. The
print pointed down toward the town of Rideway,
which they could see in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went down into town,&rdquo; said Terry. &ldquo;Suppose
we follow down there, and see where the
print leads to?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>Following the marked heel down into Rideway
was not an easy task. In some places they lost all
traces of it and had to look around for half an
hour before finding the faint mark again. But the
trail led steadily down the opposite slope from
the camp until it went into town. But here they
lost it for good.</p>
<p>The main road was hard as a rock, with a glazed
surface that left no trace of any mark. They followed
this road down through town for a long
way, but there was no further sign of the marked
heel. Their next move was to look along the sides
of the road to see if the man had walked off it at
any point, but after a good hour had been spent in
this way the cadets gave it up as a bad job.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad,&rdquo; groaned Jim. &ldquo;Right at the most important
part we lose it altogether. I guess that&rsquo;s
the end of an important clue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, looks like we have exhausted this possibility,&rdquo;
agreed Jordan. &ldquo;Anyway, we have given
the town people something to wonder about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was true. The natives of Rideway had
been watching the boys with curiosity. So busy
had they been in their search that they had failed
to pay any attention to the citizens, but the people
had not failed to note what they were doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; Don warned. &ldquo;Here comes that nasty
sheriff.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>From a small, one-story shack near them the tall
sheriff made his way. His eyes were fixed on the
boys and he swaggered in their direction. They
were not aware of it, but he had been watching
them from his window for the last several minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be careful what we say to this fellow,&rdquo;
Terry warned in a low voice. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tell him we
just came to town for a visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sheriff had now come within hailing distance.
Hands on hips he surveyed the cadets with
vast contempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;re you soldier boys doing here?&rdquo; he
boomed in a voice sufficiently loud to attract the
attention of the passersby. A small ring instantly
collected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just looking your town over,&rdquo; smiled
Jordan easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking my town over, eh? I guess you are
pretty thorough about it. Examining the streets to
see what kind of dust we have here, I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; nodded Terry innocently. &ldquo;It is just like
the dust they have every place else!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep your mouth closed, young fellow!&rdquo;
rumbled the sheriff, turning smoldering eyes on
the cheerful redhead. &ldquo;If I have any funny talk
from you boys I&rsquo;ll lock you up quicker&rsquo;n a wink.
I want to know what you boys are doing snooping
around the street here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here looking for a man who has been
prowling about our camp lately,&rdquo; said Jordan, seeing
that nothing was to be gained by evading the
issue any longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What man is prowling around your camp?&rdquo;
the sheriff demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what we would like to know,&rdquo; responded
the senior captain. &ldquo;Not long ago a man
stampeded our horses and last night he left a
warning in our tree in our camp, telling us to
keep our noses out of this ghost business. We
found a heel print in the mud under that tree and
we have followed it down into this town. That&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody has been anywhere near your camp,&rdquo;
the sheriff declared loudly. &ldquo;You boys have been
dreaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; spoke up Jim, sharply. &ldquo;Listen
here, Mr. Sheriff, I saw that man stampede our
horses. Whoever is hanging around the camp had
better keep away from it and stay away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll you do if he doesn&rsquo;t stay away?&rdquo; scoffed
the sheriff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do what you should have done long ago,&rdquo;
snapped Don. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find him and send him to a
responsible officer of the law to take care of. You
are supposed to be a sheriff here, keeping law and
order, and yet a silly ghost terrifies the community
for years and you aren&rsquo;t able to run him down.
We&rsquo;re neither too stupid nor too lazy to do it and
if the ghost or any of his friends are here in this
crowd I&rsquo;m telling you plainly that we&rsquo;re going to
nail him and nail him hard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an awed rustle in the crowd. The
sheriff turned purple with wrath. He shook a long
and bony finger at the cadets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You imitation soldiers, listen to me,&rdquo; he
roared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m warning you to keep your nose out
of affairs on this Ridge! I&rsquo;m the sheriff here and
what I say goes. If I catch you meddling around
with anything again I&rsquo;ll lock you up so fast you
won&rsquo;t know what hit you. You mind your own
business about people and things at Rustling
Ridge, do you get me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As far as people on the Ridge go, we do get
you,&rdquo; retorted Jordan. &ldquo;But not where it concerns
this ghost who has been coming into our camp at
night. If he insists upon visiting us, then it is our
business to try to find him. That&rsquo;s all there is to
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Realizing that there was no use in arguing further
the boys left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s an open declaration of war,&rdquo;
chuckled Terry, as they made their way back to
camp. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ll have to buck that sheriff
all the way along the line.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, because it is even possible that he has
something to do with the ghost business himself,&rdquo;
said Vench, seriously. &ldquo;Anyway, he is mighty
touchy about the whole thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is because he considers himself the King
of the Ridge, and it hurts his pride to see anyone
else butt in,&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;Wonder what the colonel
will say when we tell him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colonel heard them in silence. Then he
spoke to them quietly. &ldquo;You did perfectly right,
boys,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;However, in the future steer clear
of him. I don&rsquo;t think he really amounts to much,
but he may make things pretty unpleasant. In
spite of him, we&rsquo;ll get this ghost yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colonel accompanied the boys to the tent
entrance when they left. Outside they found Lieutenant
Thompson with a number of other cadets
staring fixedly across the Ridge.</p>
<p>At the sound of the colonel&rsquo;s voice Thompson
turned his gaze to the headmaster and said, &ldquo;Sir,
I believe that someone is sending us a wigwag
message from that hill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All eyes swung toward the distant hill. Sure
enough, far up at the top two tiny white flags
moved in the semaphore signal. Whoever was doing
it knew the code and they stared in fascination
as the flags moved steadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is repeating his message, boys,&rdquo; said the
colonel, breaking the silence that had settled upon
them. &ldquo;Be sure you get it this time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>The camp was completely silent as the cadets
strained their eyes to read the wigwag message.
When it finished a burst of excitement and amazement
followed. The mysterious flagman had signaled
unmistakably: &ldquo;Be on your guard. The
Ghost walks tonight!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<h2 id="c13">13
<br /><span class="small">The Shape in the Moonlight</span></h2>
<p>Great was the astonishment as the cadets made
out the signal from the opposite side of the hill.
At least nine-tenths of them had read the message
accurately, for a knowledge of signaling, both in
the Morse code and the semaphore, was required
at the school. After the message was received they
stood staring toward the hill, looking for some
further word. When the same message had been
repeated three times the colonel awoke to the fact
that the signalman was not going to say anything
more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Walker,&rdquo; he called to the best signalman
that the corps had. &ldquo;Get your flags and answer
&lsquo;All right.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cadet Walker departed on a run to his tent,
to reappear shortly with two white flags. Standing
where he would surely be seen by the lone signalman,
the cadet began his message. The flags on
the other side of the Ridge disappeared at once as
the man read their signal, and Walker stopped
his rapid arm movements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what in the world do you make of that?&rdquo;
Terry asked, in amazement. His question was
taken up by all of the cadets and asked without
any satisfactory answer. Supper was neglected
while the mystery was considered, and the colonel
was as much puzzled as the boys were.</p>
<p>When the cadets finally did sit down to supper
the tables buzzed with speculative talk. Many
were for going over to that hill and finding out
who it could have been that signaled them. At the
close of the meal the colonel rapped for order and
when the tent had become quiet he spoke to them
of the future plans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know as little about that signal as you do,
boys,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I believe it to be sincere.
Someone who is friendly is trying to give us a
warning that may stand us in good stead. It is also
possible that it may be a hoax, simply designed to
fool us or to draw us out of camp. That will not
happen, you may be sure, but I feel that we should
be ready for duty. I shall split the battalion in half,
and one-half of you will patrol the Ridge while
the other half remains in camp to guard it against
surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a stirring and a ripple of genuine
pleasure at the news, for all of the young men
looked forward to some exciting times ahead. Each
one was wishing that he would be lucky enough
to be in the group that would patrol the Ridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to make this statement, which is also an
order,&rdquo; went on the colonel. &ldquo;There will be no
carrying of arms tonight. Some one of you might
become excited and fire at the wrong time, so I
expressly forbid it. It is not as though you were
going out alone, but you are going out in groups
and therefore a weapon, in the shape of a firearm,
won&rsquo;t be necessary. I trust that five or six husky
young cadets will be a match for the best ghost
this Ridge can send against us. It may be that we
will have our supreme chance to end this ugly
ghost business tonight, and if so I want no slips
that will damage the prospect. I wish to see the
leaders immediately after the meal.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>When the colonel met with the leaders he specified
which cadets were to go out and which ones
were to stay at camp. To their joy all of the friends
of Don and Jim were to patrol the Ridge. The
colonel had suggested that the Ghost Patrol go in
a body, so the members of that secret organization
prepared to go out alone. The leaders passed from
group to group, telling them where to go and how
to act, signals were arranged, and the stage was set.</p>
<p>To the waiting cadets it seemed that evening
was unusually slow in coming. No attempt was
made to slip out of camp until full darkness had
come, for if anyone was watching it would be a
risky thing to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never saw a day last so long in my life,&rdquo; grumbled
Vench, digging his heel into the soft mud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just about the usual length, I guess,&rdquo;
smiled Don. &ldquo;One thing is going to be for and
against us tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; the others asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be just enough of a moon to make
us have to be careful, and just enough to help us
spot the ghost if he gets out into the open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jordan emerged from his tent and stopped at
the various groups to give some sort of an order.
When he got to the members of the Ghost Patrol
he repeated it finally.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;When we leave the camp we are to leave by
the back way, taking care to keep out of the light
of the fires,&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;It is possible that
someone is watching the camp and our game
would be spoiled if we walked out in such a way
that it could be seen. In about a half hour we will
be able to get going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bunch in camp will have to keep their
eyes wide open,&rdquo; said Douglas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and the colonel will be helping them do
it. We have to be careful that this isn&rsquo;t all some
tricky plan to pull us out of camp while somebody
with kindly ideas rushes in and burns the place
out. The colonel has arranged this signal: three
rifle shots for a recall. That will mean trouble in
the camp, and if you hear it, head for camp as fast
as you can go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darkness finally fell and the stars appeared
faintly in the summer sky as the slice of the moon
cut the distant horizon. One group broke up and
disappeared back of the tents and another followed.
Jordan got up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; he announced, glancing at
his watch. &ldquo;Slip out of camp without a sound.
Keep to the shadows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The group in the tent broke up at once, some
of them walking down the company street for a
distance of three or four tents and then slipping
behind them. Once out of the glare of the several
campfires they had no trouble in gaining the shelter
of the trees, and after a few seconds they were
all together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;Which direction now?&rdquo; Jim asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go clear to the top of the Ridge,&rdquo; suggested
Jordan. &ldquo;From there we can get a comprehensive
view of the woods and hills and spot anything
that moves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They set out for the top of the Ridge, walking
with care and listening for every sound that might
break the stillness. They had not gone far before
there was a noise as though someone was moving
before them. Spreading out fanwise they bore silently
down on the spot from which the noise had
come only to run into another patrol which was
lying low and waiting for them to come forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is only you guys,&rdquo; grunted Jordan, as
Cadets Perry, Noxan, Dodge and Orlan confronted
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sorry to disappoint you by not being the
ghost!&rdquo; grinned Perry. &ldquo;But we heard you coming
along and we took to cover, so that you would
run into us. I&rsquo;m afraid that we&rsquo;ll be doing that all
evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then let&rsquo;s get over it by giving the school
whistle every time,&rdquo; suggested Don. &ldquo;If we had
whistled then you would have replied and we
would have passed you in another direction.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;A good idea, Mercer,&rdquo; approved Dodge. &ldquo;If
we give the whistle and fail to receive the answer,
we&rsquo;ll know that the party before us is a suspicious
case. We can then go after them in earnest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that will be OK,&rdquo; nodded the senior
captain. &ldquo;We are striking off here, boys. See you
later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that they left the party and continued
their journey to the top of the hill. From there
they could look all along the Ridge, and even
see the faint gleam of their own campfires in the
distance. There was no sign of life on the Ridge,
but that was inconclusive, for they knew that directly
below them several bands of cadets were
moving around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the time being at least we will just stay
here and sweep the hills with our eyes,&rdquo; Jordan
said.</p>
<p>For a full hour they sat under a tree, well-sheltered
in its shadows, and looked searchingly at the
slopes below them. In that time the only life they
saw were the forms of several cadets who appeared
briefly in the open and then were lost in
the darkness. Finally they became highly impatient
at the inaction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess there is nothing to be gained by sitting
here,&rdquo; Jordan said. &ldquo;My suggestion is that we split
up and move along the top of the Ridge in opposite
directions. Suppose Terry, Jim and Don come
with me, and Thompson, Douglas and Vench
group together and go toward the east of the
Ridge? We&rsquo;ll work back past the camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds as good as anything,&rdquo; nodded Thompson.
&ldquo;Most of our cadets are content to stay down
on the slopes, so it wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea to keep
to the top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and here&rsquo;s another thing,&rdquo; put in Terry.
&ldquo;You three are going toward the town. Why not
keep an eye on that side of the Ridge and see if
this ghost doesn&rsquo;t come up from town, if he comes
at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be something in that,&rdquo; said Jordan.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll watch this side of the hill. By the way, have
all of you fellows got your cadet whistles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of them had the regular whistles, similar to
those used by traffic policemen. &ldquo;If you get into a
scrape and need help, just blow like mad,&rdquo; commanded
Jordan. &ldquo;If we should run into anything
we&rsquo;ll do the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this word they separated. They were now
so high above the camp that the fires gleamed like
little fireflies below them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody or something moving in the bushes
below!&rdquo; whispered Jim, suddenly. He pointed
into a small gully below them and they looked
down. The bushes, clearly seen in the pale moonlight,
were moving.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll whistle,&rdquo; said Jordan, and did so. But there
was no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down we go, and see who it is,&rdquo; decided the
captain, and they crept forward stealthily, careful
to make as little noise as possible. But when they
dipped down in the gully they found four cadets,
one of whom was Rowen. These cadets were standing
like statues, evidently a bit scared and waiting
to see who it was that moved toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you fellows hear my whistle?&rdquo; Jordan
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought we heard someone whistle,&rdquo; replied
Cadet Motley. &ldquo;But we weren&rsquo;t sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I whistled,&rdquo; Jordan said. &ldquo;Whenever
you hear that you&rsquo;ll know that friends are near
by.&rdquo; Jordan then repeated Don&rsquo;s suggestion to use
their special whistle for recognizing cadets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; nodded Motley. &ldquo;What time have you,
Jordan? I&rsquo;m not sure about my watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jordan drew out his watch. &ldquo;I have just eleven
o&rsquo;clock, Motley,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I guess&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim gripped his arm. &ldquo;Siss&mdash;s!&rdquo; he hissed. &ldquo;Look,
on the top of the Ridge!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>With one accord they looked up the slope and
their blood chilled. In a patch of moonlight a
weird and terrible figure walked swiftly from one
patch of darkness toward another. It looked to be
the figure of a man, clothed entirely in white. It
glanced neither to the right nor to the left, but
strode swiftly along, to all intents and purposes
unaware that anyone save itself was on the Ridge.
Even the head was muffled in white and showed
no trace of eyes, nose or mouth. Quiet and evil
and sinister did it look as it glided past the dark
background of the sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<h2 id="c14">14
<br /><span class="small">Disobedience Loses the Game</span></h2>
<p>The cadets instinctively crouched down where
they stood. It seemed to be the proper thing to do,
although the ghostly figure had not looked in their
direction.</p>
<p>The moment was one of indecision. While the
ghost kept in plain sight on the top of the Ridge
they were content to watch it, waiting for a cue
that would send them into action. To attempt to
rush up the hill and grapple with the shape would
be the wrong thing to do, for the noise of their approach
would startle the thing into a run. To
trail it as quietly as possible was their only thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>There was a stir on the part of one of the cadets,
the one nearest Don. He reached into his inside
pocket and then brought his hand out into the
open. It was Dick Rowen who had moved and Don
shifted his eyes toward him.</p>
<p>What he saw startled him. Against all orders to
the contrary the sulky cadet had brought a revolver
with him. He was even now raising it and
pointing toward the white shape.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;s arm described a sort of arc, his hand coming
down with a thump on the wrist of the unpopular
cadet. But Rowen had a good grip on the
stock of his revolver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put that away, Rowen,&rdquo; Don whispered,
sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave me alone, Mercer,&rdquo; hissed the other.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going to scare the thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;s grasp tightened and he jerked the wrist
toward him. Rowen promptly twisted his arm,
pointing the revolver upward. The grasp of his
fingers on the trigger was too strong and the revolver
went off with a shattering report.</p>
<p>There was a moment of utter silence from the
boys themselves. The figure in white leaped into
the air and then began a swift run along the top of
the Ridge. Don had dropped Rowen&rsquo;s wrist in
dismay and the other cadet was shaken by the unexpected
happening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you stupid guy!&rdquo; cried Don, as the ghost
could be heard running along the rise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>They were all on their feet now and Jordan
pushed up to them. He grasped the cadet by the
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rowen, what in the world did you do that
for?&rdquo; he ground out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; defended the other. &ldquo;Mercer
grabbed my arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the excuses, we all saw what you
did. It was against the colonel&rsquo;s orders to carry any
kind of a gun. Why did&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don cut in. &ldquo;Some of you fellows get after the
ghost on the double!&rdquo; he cried, and Terry, Jim,
and the others ran off, leaving him alone with Jordan
and the angry one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought the colonel was foolish about
not carrying arms,&rdquo; said Rowen, as the others
breasted the rise. &ldquo;Anyway, what right had he to
send us out to face some kind of a desperate man,
maybe a criminal, without any way to protect
ourselves? I wasn&rsquo;t going to shoot the man, I was
going to scare him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You succeeded in doing that without carrying
out your original plan,&rdquo; Jordan returned, grimly.
&ldquo;Now, Rowen, I want you to march yourself back
to camp and put yourself on report. You are under
arrest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure, I could expect that from you!&rdquo; retorted
Rowen, bitterly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you could, you or anyone else who had
pulled a stunt like that,&rdquo; nodded Jordan. &ldquo;It was
direct and defiant disobedience, and if we lose our
chance to nab the ghost it will be entirely your
fault. Return to camp at once, Rowen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; grumbled Rowen. He walked sullenly
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, if we are going to catch up with the boys
we&rsquo;ll have to put all we have into it,&rdquo; announced
Jordan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; said Don, as they started up the slope.
&ldquo;Feel equal to a good stiff run?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; smiled Jordan. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hit a steady pace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gaining the top of the rise they fell into a steady
run along the top, away from the camp and toward
the town on the far side of the Ridge. They were
following a general direction, which was not entirely
blind, for far ahead of them they heard a
faint cracking sound that seemed to be made by
someone running recklessly. Their route did not
keep them long on the top of the hill, for the ghost
had taken to the deeper shelter of the trees lower
down and they plunged down the slope, threading
their way in between the trees.</p>
<p>They almost fell over a figure that was before
them in the woods. It was Cadet Owens, and he
was sitting on a rock, hugging his foot. His shoe
was off and he was breathing hard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurt yourself?&rdquo; Jordan called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; gasped Owens. &ldquo;Got my shoe
caught in a piece of rock and twisted my ankle.
But I&rsquo;ll be able to walk. Keep on going straight
ahead. We didn&rsquo;t lose sight of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other two plunged on, following a straight
line. They did not expect to overtake the others,
for Terry and Jim in particular were fast runners
and they had had a good start. All they could hope
to do was to be in at the finish if there was a finish,
and with this in mind they ran on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rough going!&rdquo; gasped Don, as they began to
ascend a second rolling hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing else but!&rdquo; returned Jordan, running
steadily.</p>
<p>On the top of the hill they found themselves in
familiar country. Far ahead of them was the tiny
cabin of Peter Vancouver and above them was the
big, barnlike house that they had observed at the
time they first took the hike to the old man&rsquo;s place.
Now they were somewhat at a loss, and slowed up
a bit in their running.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to be careful not to lose them now,&rdquo;
Don said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they are, right ahead of us,&rdquo; announced
Jordan, &ldquo;They must have lost him, because they
are just standing there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are right in front of that old house,&rdquo; observed
Don, as they ran forward.</p>
<p>The others turned in glad surprise when the
two ran up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you lose him?&rdquo; Jordan called, as they
joined them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He just bolted into that house,&rdquo; Terry answered.
&ldquo;Think we ought to go in after him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; was the reply from the senior
captain. &ldquo;All you fellows have your flashlights,
haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all had. Jordan led the way inside the
gate and they walked with great care toward the
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was way ahead of us,&rdquo; said Motley, &ldquo;and
just as soon as he got to this old house he bolted
right inside. He may be armed, so we had better
be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Jordan. &ldquo;But if he is in the house
we are bound to get him. Be ready to put your
light out if he tries any shooting. And be careful
of holes or anything in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>They snapped on their flashlights as they went
up the tottering old porch of what had once been
a fine old mansion. There were no windows in the
place which could boast of glass, and the front door
had dropped from its hinges and now lay sprawled
out on the porch. Jordan swung his light down on
this prostrate door, and they could see that it was
covered with dirt and mud. Newer marks on the
door showed that someone had recently entered
the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is where he went, all right,&rdquo; said Don.
&ldquo;On your toes, everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before entering the place they flashed brilliant
beams of light in every corner of the nearest room.
This was a large hall, with bare walls from which
the plaster had fallen, and a large staircase running
up to a second floor. Realizing that the ghost might
leave the place by some rear door while they
prowled around the front rooms, the cadets pushed
the search with all possible speed, their eyes and
ears alert for any sign of someone lurking. But a
rapid search of a wide parlor, a square dining
room, and an enormous kitchen showed them that
at least no one was concealed downstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess our next move will be the upstairs,&rdquo;
Motley suggested, and they took the wide steps
toward the top of the house.</p>
<p>Here there were a number of smaller rooms and
it took them some little time to look through all of
them. Nothing was to be found on the second floor,
and with more confidence they went to the third
floor. This was a big barnlike attic, and was obviously
quite empty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if he is in the place at all, it is the cellar,&rdquo;
decided Jordan, when they had satisfied themselves
that there was no one in the upper part of the
house. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he came upstairs at all, because
I don&rsquo;t see any prints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were some footprints in the lower hall
but they were lost on the comparatively bare
stretches of floor. The cellar, which extended only
a short distance under the house, was tenanted by
spiders only, and no one had been in there, judging
by the huge webs that stretched across the bottom
of the stairway. It would have been impossible
for anyone to have gone that way without breaking
the webs, and they were all intact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many thanks to the spiders,&rdquo; acknowledged
Terry, lifting his hat. &ldquo;They make it possible for
us to keep from going any deeper into this damp
hole. The smell of it is enough for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just to make doubly sure,&rdquo; said Jordan, &ldquo;suppose
we go around to the back and see if there is
an outside cellar door? The ghost may have run
out the back door of the house and down a back
stairs to the cellar. I&rsquo;m not going to give up the
search until I have seen every corner of the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While a couple of us are doing that I suggest
that two or three of us look in the closets on the
first floor,&rdquo; Don advanced. &ldquo;We missed them on
our first round. I guess a couple of us can hold the
ghost in a tussle until the others get on the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Jordan. &ldquo;Jim and Motley,
come with me. The rest of you scatter. But I&rsquo;m
pretty sure that the ghost ran right on through the
house and escaped into the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others thought the same thing, but they
scattered to search. Terry and Cadet Ross began
to look into the closets on the first floor. Don wandered
back into the parlor and came to the front
porch. From there he looked off over the hills,
seeing below him the lights in Vancouver&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if old Mr. Vancouver is all right?&rdquo;
Don mused. &ldquo;Maybe he heard the noise we made
and is alarmed. It isn&rsquo;t far to his house, and I think
I&rsquo;ll run down and see if he is all right. Won&rsquo;t take
a second, and I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<h2 id="c15">15
<br /><span class="small">Dawning Light</span></h2>
<p>With this kindly thought in mind Don jumped
to the ground and started off. But at that moment
Terry appeared in the black doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, where are you going?&rdquo; the redhead asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just going to run down and see if Mr. Vancouver
is OK,&rdquo; called back Don. &ldquo;Tell Jordan that
I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, kid,&rdquo; Terry returned. &ldquo;If you run
into any trouble, just sing out and we&rsquo;ll come on
the double.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>Terry turned back and was lost to sight while
Don resumed his journey down the slope. The
cabin was not far away and it took him but a moment
to reach it. He approached it from the back,
hoping to get a look in one of the windows, but
they were too high and small in the rear and so
he passed around to the front of the cabin. Noiselessly
he crossed the porch and tapped on the door,
waiting for an answer.</p>
<p>Although he waited there was no response and
he wondered if the old man was asleep. Since there
was a light showing he rather doubted that and he
knocked again, a trifle louder. The light came out
from under the door and showed around the windows
that opened off the porch, but he was unable
to peer in because heavy black shades were pulled
down to the bottom. The front door was solid and
he found no help in that direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be asleep, in spite of the light,&rdquo; Don
decided. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see if I can see anything through the
side windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made his way around the side of the house
and found that he could see in a window there. A
ragged shade had been pulled down but the torn
edges gave him a limited view of the interior of
the large room. It was lighted by a single oil lamp,
and in a far corner sat the invalid in his chair, apparently
fast asleep. At least he was very quiet and
Don was undecided.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know as I ought to tap, but I&rsquo;ll just see
if he is awake,&rdquo; he decided, and tapped with his
ring on the glass in the window. The old man
stirred, looked toward the window, and wheeled
his chair out of the shadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; he cried, in a shrill voice.</p>
<p>Don ran swiftly around the porch and placed
his lips near the door frame. &ldquo;It is Don Mercer,
one of the cadets who visited you one afternoon,&rdquo;
he called. &ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, you may,&rdquo; responded the man, instantly.
There was a soft sound, like the rolling of wheels,
and the catch on the door rattled. In an instant the
door swung open to show the frail figure in the
chair. Don was bathed in a yellow light that
blinded him for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come right in,&rdquo; invited Vancouver, spinning
back from the door. &ldquo;Close the door and make
yourself right at home. What brings you up here
at this hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don entered, closing the door back of him, and
looked around the room. A fire snapped in an
open hearth and the room was a bit too warm.
Vancouver was wrapped in a brown blanket, and
he had wheeled himself back into the shadows
beyond the lamplight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to apologize for my late call, Mr. Vancouver,&rdquo;
laughed Don. &ldquo;But a bunch of us chased
the ghost up this way and the rest of the boys are
looking for him. I saw your lights down here and
just ran in to see if you were all right, or if our
noise had alarmed you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were chasing the ghost!&rdquo; cried Vancouver,
sharply. &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we saw him walking along the Ridge and
we gave chase,&rdquo; Don explained. &ldquo;We trailed him
into that old house on the top of the hill and we
went all through the place but couldn&rsquo;t find him.
While the others were looking I ran down here to
see if you had heard anything. Sorry to have bothered
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t any bother at all, and I&rsquo;m grateful to
you for your thought,&rdquo; responded Vancouver
promptly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear anything because I&rsquo;ve
been sleeping here in the chair. Your knock woke
me up. So you saw the ghost, eh? What did he look
like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don described the appearance of the ghost and
the old man appeared to be deeply interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say you fellows saw him. How&rsquo;d you come
to do that? You ain&rsquo;t always out of your camp so
late as this, be you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling that he might some day help them to
find the ghost, Don related the story of the mysterious
flagman, the search on the hill and the revolver
shot that Rowen had fired off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, too bad about that shot,&rdquo; said the invalid,
shaking his head. &ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for that
you would have nailed this ghost, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt of it,&rdquo; said Don, his attention attracted
by something that the man was doing. &ldquo;Are
you too hot, Mr. Vancouver?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The invalid had been passing a hand jerkily
across his forehead several times, and each time
after the act he wiped a somewhat dampened hand
on the brown cover. Although it was quite warm
in the place it did not seem to be hot enough to
make a man sweat, unless Mr. Vancouver was the
kind who perspired easily. It seemed to Don that
the old man was breathing pretty heavily for one
who had sat in a wheel chair all evening, and in
the boy&rsquo;s brain a faint idea stirred. He rejected it,
at first, but like a gentle knocking it persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no,&rdquo; hastily interposed the cripple.
&ldquo;Do you feel too warm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I thought perhaps you might be a little
hot, and I&rsquo;d open a window or the door for you,&rdquo;
responded Don, seating himself on the edge of
the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you needn&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; said the man, running
one thumb absently along the edge of the
nearest wheel. The glance that he fixed on the
cadet&rsquo;s face was keen and almost fierce. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so
old I got to keep warm, because I don&rsquo;t move
around enough.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; nodded Don. He had intended to leave
immediately, but found himself suddenly possessed
with a desire to remain. &ldquo;Well, as I was
telling you, we chased that ghost into the old
house above you. Know anything about the
place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same time Don began a rigid inspection
of his host. Most of the man was covered up, but
his feet showed under the blanket. Only the toes
could be seen, but there was something about them
that attracted his attention. They were clothed
in socks which seemed to be damp, and he wondered
if the man always went without shoes.</p>
<p>Vancouver knew the place well. &ldquo;They used to
call that the haunted house, around here,&rdquo; he
chuckled. &ldquo;This Ridge is a pretty spooky place,
the more you hear of it. You don&rsquo;t know who it
was that sent you that flag message, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t the least idea,&rdquo; answered Don. &ldquo;All
of the cadets were in camp at the time, and I don&rsquo;t
know who around here knows how to use signal
flags. And who would know that the ghost was
going to walk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You beat me there,&rdquo; Vancouver said, shaking
his head. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a hard nut to crack. Maybe the
ghost went in for a little advertising.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it, Mr. Vancouver,&rdquo; said Don, noting
that the fire was consuming fresh wood which
couldn&rsquo;t have been put there an hour ago. &ldquo;If you
had seen the ghost run you&rsquo;d have known that the
thing was utterly unexpected to him. It is a pretty
tough problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess most ghost doings are tough problems,&rdquo;
grinned the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; Don smiled. &ldquo;Nice fire you have
there. We don&rsquo;t see many open hearth fires any
more. Have you had it going all evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, I generally have it going every evening,&rdquo;
responded the man, somewhat absently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll have to be running along, Mr. Vancouver,&rdquo;
he said, glancing at his watch. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to keep you at an hour like this. I just wanted
to run down and see if we had alarmed you, but
as long as we haven&rsquo;t, why, I&rsquo;ll be moving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear a sound, so I&rsquo;m all right. It was
real nice of you to drop down to see if I was all
right, and I sure appreciate that. An old cripple
like me doesn&rsquo;t get much chance to see the world
or talk with anyone, so it did me good to have you
stop in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; replied Don, his eyes busy at the
task of looking around the room in a guarded manner.
&ldquo;Say, Mr. Vancouver, as I told you before,
we did quite a bit of running tonight. And gee,
I&rsquo;m just about burning up with thirst. I&rsquo;m thinking
with pleasure that you have some of the finest
water I ever tasted here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you a drink in just a shake,&rdquo; promised
the man, seizing his wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother. Can&rsquo;t I get it myself?&rdquo; asked
Don, wishing to gain a look at the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t take me a second,&rdquo; said the other, and
spun around in his chair, aiming at the doorway
that led into the back room. With the speed and
accuracy of an arrow he passed through it and was
gone.</p>
<p>And almost immediately Don thanked his lucky
stars that he had not been permitted to go out into
the other room himself. For something that had
been hidden by the chair of the cripple was now
disclosed. In the corner rested a pair of shoes, and
these shoes were covered with mud!</p>
<p>Not the slightest doubt about it. Red and black
mud, soft and wet, a fact that he could determine
without touching them. A band of light from the
lamp shone on them and revealed the evidence
plainly. That explained the man&rsquo;s damp socks.
Yet Don&rsquo;s brain was unable to fully take it all in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible that this man is not an invalid
after all? Or has the real ghost been here, and
maybe is hiding here right now? That may be
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>But certain things pointed an unerring hand
at his host. His brow was moist, as of one who had
been running. His breath had been rapid, and
now his muddy shoes betrayed him. For not an
instant longer did Don doubt that the man could
walk and run, and the crippled state was nothing
but a ruse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder he pumped me about who it was
that sent the wigwag,&rdquo; he thought, as the sound of
water was heard from the kitchen pump. &ldquo;While
I have been sitting here telling him everything he
has been measuring me, wondering if I have been
playing some sort of a game with him. Maybe I&rsquo;m
lucky that he didn&rsquo;t jump on me suddenly, but I
believe that my straightforward story has convinced
him that I don&rsquo;t know anything. Nothing
dumb about him, evidently! My story about running
down to see if he is all right must sound
pretty flat, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man wheeled into the room rapidly and in
his hand he had a tall glass of water. Don drank it
eagerly, keeping a wary eye on the old man, but
nothing out of the way happened and he thanked
him for the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it,&rdquo; smiled the man. &ldquo;Come up
again and see me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I surely will,&rdquo; promised Don, as he opened the
door. &ldquo;Good night, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, boy, good night,&rdquo; was the bright
and cheery response, as Don went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he isn&rsquo;t a cripple, he certainly knows how to
run that chair of his,&rdquo; Don decided, as he ran up
the hill.</p>
<p>He found that the others were waiting for him
impatiently. &ldquo;Golly, we thought that you were
lost,&rdquo; said Jordan, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, just talking with Mr. Vancouver,&rdquo; said
Don. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t have any luck, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; returned the senior captain. &ldquo;Well,
I suppose we may as well head in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It did not take them long to make camp, where
they found the others awaiting them. Jordan reported
to the colonel, who had heard the shot and
who knew from Rowen&rsquo;s own report what had
happened. Howes was ordered to blow the bugle
as a sign of recall, and before very long all of the
groups had returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad we lost him,&rdquo; said the colonel, shaking
his head. &ldquo;I believe it was entirely due to Mr.
Rowen&rsquo;s disobedience. I have ordered him into
permanent arrest, until I decide what to do with
him. Sound taps, Mr. Howes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>Don thought deeply before falling asleep. &ldquo;I
guess I&rsquo;ll keep things to myself, at least for a time,&rdquo;
he decided. &ldquo;It all sounds so farfetched that I hate
to drag out my discoveries. But that man was
surely out of his chair and out of his house this
night! Now that I have something definite to work
on something tangible may come up before long.
The next thing we had better do is to find out
who that mysterious flagman was.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<h2 id="c16">16
<br /><span class="small">Listening In</span></h2>
<p>The following day the camp was vibrant with
excitement as the cadets relived the events of the
night before. Everyone, of course, lamented the
fact that Rowen had unwisely frightened the ghost
away, but the boys realized that there was nothing
to do but wait for the ghost to walk again.</p>
<p>During the afternoon some of the cadets noticed
a stranger enter the colonel&rsquo;s tent. The caller
stayed a short time and then left, taking the road
which led to Rideway. Later Jordan, Don and Jim
were ordered to the colonel&rsquo;s tent. Having seen
the visitor, they wondered if their summons was
in any way connected with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, come in,&rdquo; invited the colonel as the
boys approached his quarters. &ldquo;I have a job for you
to do, that is, if you are willing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything you say, Colonel,&rdquo; Don replied,
speaking for the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you noticed that I had a visitor this
afternoon.&rdquo; He looked at the three cadets before
him expectantly and they nodded to affirm this.
&ldquo;That was Mr. Farnsworth, the superintendent of
the local telephone exchange in Rideway. It seems
that his night operator was suddenly taken ill this
morning and will be unable to go on duty tonight.
He has no extra help at this time and
thought perhaps one of the cadets knew how to
operate a switchboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have run our switchboard at school a few
times,&rdquo; said Jim, hesitantly. &ldquo;However, I imagine
this one in Rideway is far more complicated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; said the colonel. &ldquo;I thought I remembered
correctly that you had, Jim. You will
have no trouble at all with this local exchange. Mr.
Farnsworth assured me that it was a simple board,
else he would not have approached me. You see,
this exchange is a small one and does not require
a complicated system such as those one finds in
large cities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll do my best, sir,&rdquo; promised Jim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of that. Now, Don and Jordan, I want
you to accompany Jim. You are to be at the exchange
from midnight until seven o&rsquo;clock, so perhaps
three of you can keep one another awake
for that period. Mr. Farnsworth will meet you
there and show you what to do. Now, I suggest
that you try to get some sleep before midnight.
You will be awakened at the proper time and
when you get to Rideway go to the building on the
left of the town hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never can tell,&rdquo; the colonel continued
with a wink, &ldquo;but what this job may be far from
dull. Remember that you are still members of the
Ghost Patrol. Be alert!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three lucky cadets went immediately to
their tents to talk over the piece of good news.
They ate supper and after an hour turned in to
sleep. Terry wailed at the fate that had left him
out of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some guys have all the luck,&rdquo; he whined in a
voice imitating Dick Rowen&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand these
Mercer boys, anyway. Besides, I&rsquo;ve got the biggest
ears and the colonel should have sent me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>The Officer of the Guard awakened the boys at
the proper hour and they left the camp, passing
the sentries safely. It did not take them long to
cross the Ridge and strike down into Rideway.
They found the streets totally deserted. Alongside
the town hall they found the proper building and
at their knock they were admitted by Mr. Farnsworth.
He wore a telephone headset, consisting of
one phone, a curved mouthpiece that fastened to
the soundbox which rested on his chest, and a
long, detachable plug.</p>
<p>He showed them the switchboard bearing scores
of small white buttons that lighted up when the
calls came in, and rows of multiple holes into
which the plugs were inserted when calls were
connected. He explained things in brief detail to
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is what they call a manual board, as
against a dial board,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We have five girls
working here in the daytime, but one operator is
sufficient at night. Now, unless you have some
questions, I&rsquo;ll be leaving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I understand this sort of system,&rdquo;
answered Jim promptly. &ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t cause us any
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus assured, Mr. Farnsworth left. Then the
three boys got a fair insight into the night telephone
operator&rsquo;s job. There was complete silence
until two-thirty when a call was received. Jim
handled it expertly. There were few calls after
that and the time went by much too slowly for
the three active boys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;This certainly is a lonely job,&rdquo; remarked Jordan,
around a quarter after three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I imagine you get used to it after
a while,&rdquo; answered Don.</p>
<p>Just at that moment the switchboard buzzed
twice. &ldquo;Hmm, long distance,&rdquo; murmured Jim.
&ldquo;Mr. Farnsworth mentioned that two short rings
was the signal for a long-distance call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He plugged in below the lighted signal. At his
answer a dull voice said, &ldquo;Let me have Main
7200.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jordan was about to speak when Jim sat bolt
upright and signaled to the others to be silent. His
eyes grew as big as saucers as he listened intently.
Don and Jordan were mystified by his actions, but
they said not a word. It seemed an interminable
length of time before Jim closed the key and
plugged into another line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Don questioned
his brother eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it in a minute. I&rsquo;ve got
to do something first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others listened impatiently while Jim held
a short conversation with someone who seemed to
be another operator. At last Jim removed the headset
and turned to his companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a call to the drugstore and it was
about the ghost!&rdquo; Jim said breathlessly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Don and Jordan together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just on the point of closing the key, after
making sure that the connection was correct, when
I heard someone say, &lsquo;Those cadets chased the
ghost into the old Furmen house and very nearly
caught him.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s when I motioned to you not
to talk. Then the other voice said, &lsquo;Those meddling
cadets again, was it?&rsquo; and the person at the
drugstore, who gave his name as Rose, answered,
Yes, Mr. Maul.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maul!&rdquo; shouted Don. &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s the name
of the family the Hydes had a feud with!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there is one of them still alive,&rdquo; Jordan
said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the same conclusion I reached,&rdquo; Jim
said. &ldquo;I just checked the origin of the call with the
operator and she told me it was from a pay station
in Crossland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly! Wait until the colonel hears about this.
I&rsquo;ll bet he never dreamed we would really come up
with something tonight,&rdquo; Jordan said excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t told you everything,&rdquo; Jim interrupted.
&ldquo;The man named Maul gave the clerk
instructions to relay to the ghost. He is to go to
him this afternoon and tell him to start prowling
on the far side of the Ridge. In about a week he
said he would send orders referring to another
attempt to burn the Hydes out. His final word
was, &lsquo;First I will get rid of those schoolboy
soldiers.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;That means another chance to catch the
ghost!&rdquo; exclaimed Jordan. &ldquo;Say, we ought to trail
that clerk when he goes out this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll tell you just where he will go, too,&rdquo;
said Don calmly. He had been unusually quiet
during the conversation between his brother and
Jordan, because he had been thinking things out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; the others demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the cabin of Peter Vancouver,&rdquo; returned
Don.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why to him?&rdquo; asked Jordan. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s lame and
can&rsquo;t get about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My best uniform that he isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Don laughed.
&ldquo;Let me tell you what happened the night we
chased the ghost.&rdquo; With that he related the story
of his visit to Vancouver&rsquo;s cabin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m positive that
he had been out that night, and I don&rsquo;t think for a
minute that he is an invalid at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without arousing suspicion, let&rsquo;s try to find
out from Mr. Farnsworth how long the man has
been living in that cabin,&rdquo; Jim suggested.</p>
<p>The others agreed to the idea and waited impatiently
for seven o&rsquo;clock to come. At last it did
and Mr. Farnsworth was prompt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>He thanked them earnestly and inquired whether
they had had any difficulties. Jim assured him he
had not. Mr. Farnsworth was a friendly person
and was very interested in the cadets&rsquo; activities.
He kept the boys there for a few minutes, asking
them questions concerning their camp life.</p>
<p>The superintendent&rsquo;s interest enabled the boys
to describe their hikes through the countryside
and, in passing, Jim told him of their visit to
Peter Vancouver. He then casually asked Mr.
Farnsworth if Vancouver was a native of the region.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; was the man&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;He moved here
only a few years ago. No one knows much about
him. He keeps to himself, though of course that&rsquo;s
natural since he&rsquo;s confined to a wheelchair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a few minutes of further conversation the
cadets departed.</p>
<p>They struck the trail for camp at a rapid pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good golly, I am hungry,&rdquo; sighed Jim, as they
topped the rise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we all are,&rdquo; replied Jordan. &ldquo;But we
have made splendid progress in the last few hours.
What a rare piece of luck that you listened in on
that call, Jim!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They arrived in camp while drill was going
on and reported at once to the colonel. He was interested
and pleased beyond measure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is splendid work, boys,&rdquo; he approved,
heartily. &ldquo;Now, some of you must do some active
trailing. I suppose you three feel equal to the observation
task, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will after we have had some breakfast, sir,&rdquo;
Don smiled back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. Report to the mess tent at once.
Pack something up to take with you and then
get your field glasses and find a post from which
you can watch the cabin of this supposed cripple. I
compliment you on your fine powers of observation
regarding this Peter Vancouver, Don.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; acknowledged Don. &ldquo;It is a
clever game all the way through, and only lucky
accidents have put us in touch with the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the kind of accidents that you boys always
seem to have,&rdquo; said the colonel, dryly. &ldquo;Well,
run along to your breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re having all the fun,&rdquo; grinned Jim, as
they hiked once more to the top of the Ridge a
short time later. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t old redhead pull his hair
out in handfuls when he hears of this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A small clump of bushes on a high hill gave
them a good view of Vancouver&rsquo;s cabin when
sighted through the glasses and there was no danger
that they would be seen in turn. The morning
passed without any sign of anything moving and
they ate their lunch under a hot sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He surely ought to show up this afternoon,&rdquo;
Jordan thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;If he waits until nightfall we&rsquo;re licked,&rdquo; said
Jim.</p>
<p>The afternoon dragged until four o&rsquo;clock, and
then Jordan uttered an exclamation. He had his
glasses pointed at the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he comes now,&rdquo; he announced, and the
others raised their glasses. Sure enough, a man
was wending his way up the slope, straight for
Vancouver&rsquo;s cabin, and Jim called their attention
to a white package that he had in his hand.</p>
<p>The clerk stayed in the cabin for an hour and
departed at the end of that time. When he had
gone, Jordan closed his glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes the case complete,&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;Now we can go back and report to the colonel.
Who wants to bet that I don&rsquo;t stay up until taps
tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; returned Jim, promptly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so
dead on my feet right now that I won&rsquo;t know
whether you do or not!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<h2 id="c17">17
<br /><span class="small">Breaking Up Hydes&rsquo; Party</span></h2>
<p>On the following morning Colonel Morrell had
an early and unexpected visitor. He was a fairly
good-looking young man, with a handsome smile
and a confident air. Without introducing himself
he asked the colonel of the cadet corps an astonishing
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what luck did you have with the ghost
the other night?&rdquo; the man inquired with a pleasant
smile.</p>
<p>There was a pause before the colonel answered
him. &ldquo;Unfortunately we missed him after a considerable
chase. Are you the one who&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I sent you the wigwag,&rdquo; replied the young
man. &ldquo;I am a scoutmaster over in Rideway and
that&rsquo;s how I happen to know the signals. I&rsquo;ve been
wanting to put this stupid ghost out of business
and saw this opportunity to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you come to find out that the ghost
was going to walk, Mr.&mdash;?&rdquo; began the colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Benson,&rdquo; explained the other.
&ldquo;Between 1:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span> and 8:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span> I am employed
as a telephone operator on the local switchboard.
I was suddenly taken ill the other day or I would
have been up to see you sooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so you&rsquo;re the night operator. Some of our
boys filled in for you in your absence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Farnsworth has told me about that. It was
very kind of you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is good training for our boys. It makes
them realize their responsibility as citizens to
help in any sort of emergency which may arise, I
believe. But tell me why you warned us of the
ghost&rsquo;s activities.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was really an accident that I heard a conversation
that morning which gave me the information.
There was a long-distance telephone
call made to our local drugstore. I connected the
line and rang. Then, forgetting to close my key
more than anything else, I listened while the receiver
was picked up at the drugstore. I was pretty
sleepy at the time, but I was knocked wide awake
by hearing the party on the far end of the wire
say: &lsquo;What are the latest activities, Rose? I know
about the failure to burn Hyde&rsquo;s farm. Has the
ghost walked since?&rsquo; That staggered me and I
listened closely to what followed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Morrell leaned forward in his chair.
The story of the young scout leader was of great
interest to him.</p>
<p>Mr. Benson continued. &ldquo;The voice at the other
end was a low, cold sort of voice, and I was trying
to catch a clue from it, hoping that the clerk would
use a name, but he didn&rsquo;t. He just kept using the
title Sir. This voice at the other end said: &lsquo;I know
all about those cadets interfering with the activities
of the ghost, and I will attend to them personally
very soon. When I do, they won&rsquo;t have so
much as a tent left to them or a single horse! But
I don&rsquo;t want the ghost to stay in just because of
those soldiers. Tell him to get moving again, and
make it his business not to get caught.&rsquo; It was that
last statement which caused me to get word to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a good thing it was, too,&rdquo; replied Colonel
Morrell. He then proceeded to tell Mr. Benson
the facts that the boys had uncovered. When he
had finished he said, &ldquo;Rest assured that we will
get to the bottom of this unpleasant business. I will
keep you informed of any further developments,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>As soon as he left, Colonel Morrell called the
Mercers and Jordan together for a conference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems you are not the only person guilty of
listening in on telephone conversations, Jim,&rdquo; he
began. Then he told them of Mr. Benson&rsquo;s visit.
&ldquo;Now I think the next step is to engage a good
private detective and see if we can&rsquo;t have this man
Maul located in Crossland. If we merely arrest the
paid ghost and don&rsquo;t get the big man higher up
we will accomplish nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the evening meal in the mess tent the colonel
addressed his corps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, some time ago we pledged ourselves to
run down this ghost business that is troubling the
inhabitants of the Ridge and to date we have made
quite a bit of progress, even more than most of
you know. In due time full details will be related
to you, but at present it seems best to keep things
quiet. But this much I wish to tell you: we have
learned that this &lsquo;ghost&rsquo; is a hired professional who
is planning to wipe out our camp. I do not know
just how he proposes to do it, whether by fire or
mob violence, but it is planned, and according to
the information secured the blow will come soon.
I am therefore doubling the number of sentries
beginning with tonight. Your orders are to alarm
the camp instantly if anything out of the ordinary
is seen or heard. The Officers of the Guard will
exercise unwavering care and conduct rigid inspection
of posts.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>The colonel resumed his seat and there was a
buzz of excitement and indignation. The cadets
welcomed the prospect for some actual and dangerous
service, and the prospect of a mob fight
was especially alluring. But the feeling was that
any move made against them would be in the nature
of a stealthy act, and all of the cadets determined
to brace themselves for the stern business
at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any ghost tries to touch the horses I&rsquo;ll shoot
him on sight,&rdquo; growled Thompson, who loved
the animals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I hope is that they rush the camp with a
gang,&rdquo; Terry said. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that be a swell
scrap! Imagine the corps meeting a crowd of
roughnecks in a hand-to-hand battle. That would
be something to write about!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were able to write, Redhead,&rdquo; said a
cadet near by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, if the battalion couldn&rsquo;t lick any bunch
recruited around here we ought to go back to the
school and play tennis all the rest of our lives,&rdquo;
snorted Terry, who was not good at the sport and
therefore did not like it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that the attack won&rsquo;t be an open
one,&rdquo; Don told them. &ldquo;More likely to be something
shady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to know, Mercer,&rdquo; said Motley.
&ldquo;Wish I had been on that switchboard the other
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night the number of guards was doubled
and the greatest care was exercised. The Officers
of the Guard visited posts at frequent intervals
and checked up on the sentries. But the night went
by without anything out of the ordinary happening.
In the morning Benson brought news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ghost showed up in South Plains last
night,&rdquo; he reported. &ldquo;Some farmers saw him over
that way. That is some distance from here and the
ghost is following orders to the letter. I didn&rsquo;t hear
a thing last night, though I listened to every conversation.
Tonight he may come back this way.
But I don&rsquo;t know whether you will have to fear
him or not, for if you&rsquo;ll remember Maul promised
to do the job himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be on the lookout for both of them,&rdquo;
promised the colonel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>That afternoon was a warm one and the boys
went swimming. Terry had developed a slight
summer cold and so he did not go. He was sitting
in front of the tent on a box whittling a piece
of wood industriously. The camp was quiet and
the shouts of the cadets in the swimming hole
drifted to his ears.</p>
<p>There was a voice near Terry and he looked up.
The little Carson boy was approaching down the
company street from the direction of the woods
and Terry waved to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Jimmie,&rdquo; greeted Terry. &ldquo;How are you today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK, Terry,&rdquo; smiled the boy. &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you
in swimming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a little cold and the company doctor told
me to stay out for a while,&rdquo; answered the whittler,
gravely. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s on your mind today, anything
in particular?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to tell you something,&rdquo; said Jimmie
Carson, sitting down on the edge of the box as
Terry made room for him. &ldquo;You know that old
man over in the cabin? The man named Vancouver?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know who he is. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think, Mr. Mackson? He
isn&rsquo;t lame at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry stopped his whittling abruptly and looked
keenly at Jimmie. &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; he
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard the Hydes say so,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;They
are going over there tonight and kill him or something!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>The whittling ceased for good. &ldquo;The Hydes!&rdquo;
ejaculated Terry. &ldquo;How did they know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, I was over at the Hydes with my father
this morning,&rdquo; said the boy, his eyes serious and
grave. &ldquo;While Pop was talking to old man Hyde
I heard the sons talking in the barn. They didn&rsquo;t
know that I was right outside on our wagon, and
I heard them plainly. They said that one of them
had seen the man sneak into his cabin late last
night, and they found out that he wasn&rsquo;t any cripple.
Seems that one of the Hydes was driving home
from some place and he saw the ghost sneak into
the cabin. Then he looked in under a window and
saw the ghost get back into his chair, so they knew
that old man was playing ghost. Can you imagine
that, Mr. Mackson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; returned Terry gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they said they was going to go to the cabin
tonight and just about kill that old man. I thought
at first I&rsquo;d tell Pa, but I was scared to, so I come
up here to tell you fellows about it. I don&rsquo;t think
that old man ought to be hit by those big bully
Hydes, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Terry, with emphasis. &ldquo;Jimmie
boy, I&rsquo;m glad you told me this. Come along to the
colonel; we must tell him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>The colonel was keenly interested in the news.
&ldquo;Thank you for telling us this, my boy,&rdquo; he smiled
down at the rugged lad. &ldquo;This old man is a wicked
fellow to go around scaring people out of their
wits, but just as you say he shouldn&rsquo;t be hit by
those Hydes. Mr. Mackson, pass the word to the
special patrol to be ready to go with me to the
cabin as soon as darkness comes tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Colonel,&rdquo; said Terry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad
you are going along, because I feel that this is
likely to be a fairly tough situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left the tent and Terry went to hunt up
the other boys, first swearing little Jimmie to secrecy.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t breath a word of it,&rdquo; he told the
boy. &ldquo;We want to save this old man from a severe
beating and we also want to capture him for his
part in the business that has been going on around
here. So it will be the best thing if you keep very
quiet about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, Terry,&rdquo; promised the lad.</p>
<p>The others soon knew what was expected of
them. Just before they started out they met in the
tent of the colonel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Vench and Mr. Douglas, I want you to
start right away for Rideway and get the sheriff,&rdquo;
ordered the colonel. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t arrest this man
ourselves, but he must do it. It may be that we shall
have trouble with the Hydes, and anyway, the
sheriff is always saying that we interfere with his
affairs on the Ridge. You may have trouble with
the sheriff, but if you do just tell him that your
colonel requests him to come to the cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; Douglas responded, and he and
Vench went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will take side arms with us,&rdquo; said the colonel,
buckling on a revolver belt. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t have
to use them, I trust, but at least we&rsquo;ll be prepared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the others of the Ghost Patrol had
equipped themselves they set out with the colonel
for the cabin over the hill. Those in the camp saw
them go and much speculation went around as to
the purpose of the expedition. The camp itself
was in order for any emergency, with double
guards posted and the major in charge.</p>
<p>Vench and Douglas had obtained a good start
and they felt it would not be long before they returned
with the sheriff, if he could be persuaded
to come. The others swung on toward the little
cabin at a rapid pace, topping the rise and bearing
down on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s at home,&rdquo; Don said, as they came
in sight. &ldquo;There are lights in the windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but look! There are the Hydes!&rdquo; cried
Terry, pointing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>Into the patch of light from one of the small
windows a burly figure stepped and another joined
it. A third figure proclaimed the father. There
was a word of planning between them and then
one of the sons raised his foot and kicked the window
deliberately out. With that action he jumped
right through the opening and landed in the room.
A moment of silence followed and then the front
door was opened. Promptly the father and the
other son walked in and the door was shut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just in time,&rdquo; proclaimed the colonel, grimly.
&ldquo;Let us hustle, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They ran down the rest of the slope, the
doughty colonel in front, and came to the cabin
in a short time. The colonel threw himself against
the door, which had not been very well secured,
and it opened under his impact. Followed by Don,
Terry, Jim and Jordan, the colonel shot into the
room.</p>
<p>In one corner crouched the supposed invalid,
his face pale and his hands grasping a stout stick.
Facing him, with brutal expressions on their surly
faces, stood the Hydes. The oldest son held a heavy
horsewhip in his hands, and it was evident that
he was just going to use it when the cadet party
burst in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>At sight of the cadets the expressions on their
faces changed. Surprise gave way to eager gladness
on the face of the old man and spiteful anger on
the faces of the Hydes. As yet no blow had fallen
and the relief party was in the nick of time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want here?&rdquo; the father said, a
snarl in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want that man, for playing the part of a
ghost and stampeding our horses,&rdquo; said the colonel
evenly. &ldquo;And we want to see to it that you don&rsquo;t
touch that man with your whip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do, heh?&rdquo; grunted the son with the whip.
&ldquo;You all can have this old man if you want him,
but you can&rsquo;t stop us from whipping the daylights
out of him. This is the dog that burned our
barn down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know all about that,&rdquo; nodded the colonel.
&ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t horsewhip him. You can turn him
over to the proper authorities; in fact, I have already
sent for the sheriff and he will be here any
minute now. But you can&rsquo;t take the law into your
own hands, not while we are here, certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, you soldier captain, or whatever
you are!&rdquo; bellowed the senior Hyde. &ldquo;You mind
your own business. Putting this fellow in jail won&rsquo;t
do us any good, and we&rsquo;re going to beat the hide
off him. You keep out. Josh, go ahead and wallop
him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>The Hyde boy raised his whip but the colonel
reached up, jerked it from his hand and threw it
into a far corner. The Hydes grew red and
clenched their fists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give them a good beating, Pa,&rdquo; said the
younger son, and he advanced. But the colonel
drew his revolver and covered the three of them.
The other cadets dropped their hands to the butts
of their guns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come a step nearer me and I&rsquo;ll shoot you
right through the leg,&rdquo; promised the colonel,
simply.</p>
<p>The threat stopped them in their tracks. Sullenly
they fell back, hatred showing in their
faces. The old man whooped faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s handling them,&rdquo; he said, stirring eagerly.
The colonel looked at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stay where you are, too, Mr. Vancouver,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to turn you over to the law
for punishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t the only one in this game,&rdquo; blustered
the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know all about Mr. Maul,&rdquo; said the colonel.
The Hydes snapped to attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maul!&rdquo; cried the father, harshly. &ldquo;Old Maul
is dead!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;Old Maul is very much alive,&rdquo; retorted the
colonel. &ldquo;He is the one who is directing this whole
campaign. Did you think this old man was doing
it for fun? He has been paid by Maul to keep this
thing going, and he planned to burn you out of
your house pretty shortly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you ought to let us whip this sneaking
skunk!&rdquo; shouted the elder Hyde.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brutality won&rsquo;t do any good,&rdquo; returned the
headmaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes the sheriff,&rdquo; announced Jordan,
as a heavy step was heard outside the door.</p>
<p>The door opened to admit the sheriff, followed
by Vench and Douglas. The two cadets looked
grave and a trifle angry and the sheriff was his
usual blustering self.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo; he roared, looking
around. His angry eyes fastened themselves on the
colonel. &ldquo;I hear that you requested me to come
up here. Requested me! Who are you, sir? I never
saw you in my life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw you either,&rdquo; retorted the unmoved
colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the trouble here, anyway?&rdquo; sneered
the sheriff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>The trouble was explained by the colonel, but
the sheriff shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;I think you
would have done well to have minded your own
business, sir,&rdquo; said the officious man. &ldquo;This man
needs a sound horsewhipping. If it had been your
house he burned you would be the first one to
whip him. What am I supposed to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will arrest the old man and put him where
he will be safe,&rdquo; said the colonel. &ldquo;As for the
Hydes, you can&rsquo;t do anything but send them
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, colonel, are you giving me orders!&rdquo;
bellowed the loud sheriff, his face a dull red. &ldquo;If
you are, I won&rsquo;t even listen to them. Where you
get the nerve to order me around is more than I
can see. I&rsquo;ve got half a mind to run you in for
pointing a revolver at the Hydes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sheriff,&rdquo; said the colonel, hotly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you
what I&rsquo;m going to do with you. I&rsquo;m going to let
the world know how a ghost terrorized the Ridge
here for years, right under your nose, and you
never found out who it was. I&rsquo;m going to relate
how my boys discovered the whole thing, and if
you ever get another job with responsibility to it,
I don&rsquo;t know what the people of this county are
thinking of!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a total silence in the room while the
colonel and the sheriff glared at each other. The
whole frame of the sheriff shook with suppressed
rage and his breath came fast. Calmly the colonel
looked him straight in the eye. But the sheriff was
beaten and he knew it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>Instead he vented his fury upon the Hydes. &ldquo;Get
out of here and get home,&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever
let me catch you in any trouble again as long as
I&rsquo;m sheriff on this Ridge! You, Peter Vancouver,
come here while I put the handcuffs on you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<h2 id="c18">18
<br /><span class="small">The Last of the Ghost</span></h2>
<p>The Hydes had slunk off and were lost in the
darkness. The sheriff had handcuffed Peter Vancouver
and now they were on their way to the
local jail in Rideway. After putting the light out
the colonel and the members of the Ghost Patrol
left the cabin and started over the trail to camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad we got there in time to prevent
any serious injury to that old man,&rdquo; remarked the
colonel, as they walked on. &ldquo;Did you boys have
any trouble with that sheriff?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;A little bit, sir,&rdquo; Douglas replied. &ldquo;He made a
lot of noise when we explained things to him. But
he did come finally, though he talked so much and
made so much noise on the way up that Vench
and I felt like rolling him in the mud!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it was about time that somebody talked
to him,&rdquo; the colonel said. &ldquo;The people around
here are curious. They haven&rsquo;t made any effort to
run down this ghost and they take abuse from this
great blustering sheriff. But I guess this ghost
angle of things is about over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that remains now is to catch Maul,&rdquo; Jordan
reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and we&rsquo;ll see to it that steps are taken to
do that,&rdquo; the headmaster promised.</p>
<p>The sky was pitch black, and not a star in sight.
A leaden sky threatened rain and the absence of
the moon and the friendly stars made the world
below very dark indeed. Fortunately for them the
cadets knew the road fairly well, and they approached
the camp through the bushes without
having altered their course enough to puzzle them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will be hailed in about a moment,&rdquo; said the
colonel. They were close to the outpost where the
sentry was on duty, and they advanced boldly,
waiting for the call.</p>
<p>But none came. They reached the line of patrol
that the sentry was supposed to make, but they
did not run across the man who should have been
patrolling. In bewilderment they stopped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is very queer,&rdquo; murmured the colonel.
&ldquo;What can have happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry moved forward and struck his foot
against something soft. Without loss of time he
dropped to his knees, feeling before him with his
hands. The sharp intake of his breath drew their
attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; the colonel asked, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the sentry, tied up tighter than a bundle,&rdquo;
was the startling reply. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s fishy
around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others clustered around and a match was
struck. They found Cadet Innes, the sentry, lying
on his back, bound around with coarse but strong
cord. He seemed to be all right otherwise, but perfectly
speechless with a thick gag in his mouth.
By the way his eyes snapped they judged that he
had plenty to say. When the grunts of surprise
were over they went to work and soon relieved
him of the ropes and the gag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, on your lives, men!&rdquo; was his first
word, after he had licked his dry lips. &ldquo;The
man who tied me up is in the camp, up to
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any idea who it was, Mr. Innes?&rdquo; the colonel
whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. A man all in black jumped me and did
it in a hurry. Muzzled me with one hand and took
away my gun with the other. It happened before
the Officer of the Guard got around, in fact he is
due here now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say the man went toward the camp?&rdquo; was
the colonel&rsquo;s next question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, and he carried a can of kerosene with
him,&rdquo; was the startling reply. The others wasted
not another minute, but jumped to their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be very quiet as you approach the camp,&rdquo; ordered
the colonel, leading the way through the
bushes toward the camp.</p>
<p>They approached silently and looked at the
camp. It seemed deserted. Three fires showed up
red before the tents, but the cadets were in their
beds. On the other side of the camp the Officers
of the Guard could be heard as he spoke shortly
to a sentry. Otherwise there seemed to be no movement
or life in the place.</p>
<p>Don reached over and pulled the colonel&rsquo;s arm.
Close to the supply wagons a darker shadow
showed, and the faint sound of liquid bubbling
out of a can could be heard. All of the hidden
watchers caught the significance of it at once and
crouched down to wait until the man should have
come nearer them.</p>
<p>Then, something happened that changed their
plans abruptly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>A match was struck. The flare of the tiny blaze
showed a set, stern face. The man at the supply
wagon bent forward with the match.</p>
<p>Cadet Vench was little. He was also fast and happened
to be the nearest one to the stooping man.
In three strides Vench left the shelter of the
trees, sprang into the air, and landed like a monkey
on the back of the man, who had started to
straighten up at the sound of Vench&rsquo;s steps. They
both went down, the match dropped on some oil-soaked
cloth, and a fierce blaze jumped up in a
twinkling.</p>
<p>As Jim afterward said, he staked all on the size
of his feet. He landed with both shoes on the
cloth, snuffed the blaze out with a single stroke,
and saved the supply wagons and the entire camp.</p>
<p>Now all was action. A sentry near by had fired
the alarm. Vench and the unknown man were staging
a furious wrestling match on the ground beside
the wagons as the others dashed up and came to his
help. Someone threw more fuel on the nearest fire,
Major Rhodes ran up with his revolver in hand,
and the whole camp, more or less dressed, came
running after him. In the new light which the fire
showed they saw Vench and the colonel drag the
man to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just got you in time,&rdquo; said the colonel, holding
the man in a tight grip. &ldquo;Am I right when I say
your name is probably Maul?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my name is Jackson Maul,&rdquo; was the reply,
given in a deep voice. He gazed in haughty silence
around at the gaping cadets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask you to spend the rest of the night with
us in our guard tent, Mr. Maul,&rdquo; said the colonel,
his revolver in his hand. &ldquo;I may as well tell you
that your ghost game is up, and the ghost of the
Ridge safe in the county jail. I think you&rsquo;ll find
yourself in pretty heavy trouble for attempting to
fire our camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No reply was offered by the man who called
himself Maul and they took him away, where a
tent could serve as his place of imprisonment.
Major Rhodes himself took the responsibility of
watching him for the rest of the night. It was some
time before the excited cadets went back to their
beds. An examination showed them that the camp
had been soaked in oil at a number of points, and
had fire been applied to any of these places they
would have been totally wiped out. It would have
been a lucky thing if they had all escaped with
their lives had the camp been fired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>On the following morning the man Maul was
marched to Rideway and locked in jail with the
man he had paid to play ghost. The full story now
spread around the town and the Ridge people
found out how they had been terrorized for years
by the last of the Maul family in his effort to drive
the Hydes away. With this capture of the two men
the mystery of the ghost of Rustling Ridge came
to an end, and from that time forward the inhabitants
had nothing more to fear after dark.
In time the two men and the clerk Rose were all
given prison terms for mischief with malicious
intent. The Hydes kept out of trouble from that
time forward and the loud sheriff of the Ridge
became softer in his speech, at least as long as the
cadets were in the neighborhood. A number of the
county newspapers gave high praise to the cadets
and to Benson, the night telephone operator, for
public-spirited duty.</p>
<p>Soon after these events the colonel called Rowen
into his tent. He had been very much displeased
with the conduct of the cadet, but as he reflected
that things had now settled down, it would be wise
to forget the whole thing, he felt sure. So he spoke
mildly enough to the cadet, but he was surprised
when the sulky one flared back at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Colonel Morrell, I don&rsquo;t want to
talk about anything!&rdquo; was the astonishing statement.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going home right away. Everything has
been pushed against me during this whole encampment
and I&rsquo;m sick of it! I don&rsquo;t want anything
more to do with the cadet corps!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Mr. Rowen,&rdquo; returned the colonel,
still mildly. &ldquo;You say everything has been pushed
against you. But you would not believe Mercer&rsquo;s
word about the ghost starting the stampede. Now
we have the word of the ghost himself that he
started it and that Jim called out to him. Then,
against orders, you took your revolver with you
and shot it off at an improper time. Under those
circumstances, do you still feel that you had everything
against you on this camping trip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel that I have had enough of this school and
this trip,&rdquo; said Rowen. &ldquo;I guess I could have more
fun with my own friends in a summer camp where
a fellow didn&rsquo;t have to do so much unnecessary
work. I&rsquo;m going home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Rowen did go home. No one was really
sorry to see him go, for his surly temper had never
made him popular in any way.</p>
<p>From that time onward the summer slipped
along without unusual incident. It was a delightful
and happy vacation, full of swinging action and
invigorating fun, and when the time came to break
camp all of the boys were a little bit sorry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back to school again,&rdquo; said Don, as they struck
tents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and our time is getting limited,&rdquo; said
Terry, seriously. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t a whole lot more
time left to us in our school life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; Jim agreed. &ldquo;Next year Don
will be senior captain of the school.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>Before the morning was over the cadet battalion
was marching toward the school, leaving
Rustling Ridge and its many exciting memories
behind them.</p>

white men and enemy Indians so that the settlers
might lead safe and peaceful lives. But when Helen was
kidnapped by the renegades, Jonathan discovered how
much he loved her; and he and his friend Wetzel set out
on a trail of vengeance and destruction.</p>
<p>For the adventure and thrill of frontier life, <i>The Last
Trail</i> is hard to equal in the literature of the West. Zane
Grey has told his story with mastery and realism, and
readers will love this exciting story from the pen of a
master storyteller.</p>
<h3 id="c28">ON THE FORTY-YARD LINE&mdash;<i>by Jack Wright</i></h3>
<p>Jim Davis, the most popular man on the Grayson campus,
was determined to make the football team. His roommates
Bob Clark and Chub Garver were already football
man and cheerleader respectively. It was easy for Jim to
become Coach Kelso&rsquo;s star passer, but it wasn&rsquo;t so easy
to stay on the team. First, there was the secret between
Professor Burke and Jim; second, there was Weldy Gray,
who was out to ruin Jim at any cost.</p>
<p><i>On the Forty-Yard Line</i> is a story filled with the excitement
of football, and the courage and loyalty of three
pals who fight with equal abandon for their school and
for each other.</p>
<h3 id="c29">THE STRIKE-OUT KING&mdash;<i>by Julian de Vries</i></h3>
<p>From the moment Larry Murdock is chosen as regular
pitcher for the Carson College nine, to the thrilling seconds
of the big game with Northern State when Larry
battles against almost overwhelming odds, <i>The Strike-Out
King</i> is an action-packed story of the diamond that
will appeal to the sports-loving instinct of every American
boy. An absorbing book no reader will be able to
put aside until the last word of the last page has been
read.</p>
<h3 id="c30">THE WINNING BASKET&mdash;<i>by Duane Yarnell</i></h3>
<p>Honest, eager-eyed Ben Mason was in seventh heaven
when he was admitted to Clearview Academy. He had
been there only a day when they discovered he was not
from a rich, influential family&mdash;and Ben was out. How
Ben got back into Clearview, and how he fought the
antagonism of the student body and the conspiracies of
his enemy Jack Lassiter make an absorbing story filled
with drama. Every boy will root for Ben as he fights on
the basketball court for the school that didn&rsquo;t want him.</p>
<h3 id="c31">THROUGH FOREST AND STREAM: <span class="small">ADVENTURE IN THE MOUNTAINS</span>&mdash;<i>by Duane Yarnell</i></h3>
<p>When Ted and Pudge went to the All-American camp,
it was for a summer of good fun. Then they discovered
that they were really entered in a contest&mdash;a contest involving
$50,000 for the college of the boy who won it.
Ted just had to win that prize, both to keep baseball at
College Tech and to insure his father&rsquo;s job as baseball
coach. How he engaged in a deadly fight with wolves and
was entombed in an old mine shaft with a ferocious bear
are only two of the many adventures he had.</p>
<p>Ted Moran wins out in a breathless story of heroism
and resourcefulness that will thrill its readers.</p>
<h3 id="c32">OVER THE HURDLES&mdash;<i>by Emmett Maum</i></h3>
<p>Any boy who has thrilled to the shot of the starting gun
and the crunch of spiked shoes on cinders will enjoy the
story of Larry Craven, for whom the cinder track was
the path of fame from Maywood College to the Olympic
games. But all was not smooth going for Larry, for he had
many obstacles to surmount and he had enemies who
plotted against him. How he won out over his difficulties
makes an exciting and vivid sports story.</p>
<h3 id="c33">BOYS&rsquo; BOOK OF SEA BATTLES</h3>
<p class="center"><i>by Chelsea Curtis Fraser</i></p>
<p>Truth can be more exciting than fiction, as these fourteen
stirring sea battles from the pages of history prove.
From the days of Sir Francis Drake, when life on the sea
was a constant battle between the Spanish and the English,
to the Battle of Leyte, sea fights have determined
the destiny of men and nations. In these pages you will
find Commodore John Paul Jones, Lord Nelson, Oliver
Perry, Admiral David Farragut, and Dewey, together
with the dramatic stories of the <i>Constitution</i> and the
<i>Guerri&egrave;re</i>, the <i>Monitor</i> and the <i>Merrimac</i>, and the sea
battles of World Wars I and II.</p>
<h3 id="c34">BOYS&rsquo; BOOK OF FAMOUS SOLDIERS</h3>
<p class="center"><i>by J. Walker McSpadden</i></p>
<p>War transforms ordinary men into the heroes of the
battlefield, and the story of their exploits and brilliant
strategy is more exciting than any tale of fiction. The
<i>Boys&rsquo; Book of Famous Soldiers</i> brings together the stories
of thirteen immortals of history: Washington, Grant, Lee,
Jackson, Napoleon, Wellington, Foch and Joffre, Pershing,
Marshall, Eisenhower, and MacArthur&mdash;and Rodger
Young, the only enlisted man on this roster of generals.
These biographies reveal little-known facts about these
men, and the stories behind their courageous deeds and
difficult decisions.</p>
<h3 id="c35">BOYS&rsquo; BOOK OF FAMOUS FLIERS</h3>
<p class="center"><i>by Captain J. J. Grayson</i></p>
<p>From the moment Bob Martin and Hal Gregg knew that
Captain Bill, flier and storyteller extraordinary, was coming
to visit the Martins, they anticipated an exciting
summer. And exciting it was&mdash;for they learned to fly and
even soloed. But even more fascinating were the tales
Captain Bill and the boys told about the men of adventure
in aviation&mdash;the Wrights, Lindbergh, Admiral Byrd,
James Doolittle, and others.</p>
<p>Captain Grayson has told the exciting true stories of
men who made aviation history. <i>Boys&rsquo; Book of Famous
Fliers</i> is the stirring, dramatic story of aviation itself, as
embodied in the figures of America&rsquo;s most famous fliers.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p class="pg">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p class="pg">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p class="pg">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p class="pg">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p class="pg">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>
